Install Node.js and the other required files on the windows 10 machine.

Put the server folder on the windows 10 machine with Node.js.
Double clicking on "launch" in the server folder launches the Server and controlPanel

When it starts, the server displays the "server ip address".
This is required on the client machines for them to find the server.

Put the client on the client machine.
You need to use the "server ip address" on the client to see the server.
If you edit ai_old_protocol2, this address goes where you see "URL=..."

I added a folder "TXT" in the same place as the ai_old_protocol2.
By default this is the directory your bot uses to communicate.

Go to your bot and create a shortcut.
Move the shortcut to the same folder as ai_old_protocol2.
Rename the shortcut to: bot_shortcut

Double clicking on "protocol" should launch your bot and ai_old_protocol2 (using Internet Explore, which must be on the same machine).

When ai_old_protocol2 opens in Internet Explorer, you must allow it to use "ActiveX".
For me, there are a couple of warning messages that I need to click. 
If this does not come up for you, try refreshing the page.

When you click the "connection" button, you should see "ai1" turn blue, and you are connected.
