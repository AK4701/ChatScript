She's been dating him for years even though she's only 19. `01A t:  They seem lacking passion: no desire to get married or live together but not quite ready to break-up. `016 a: ( ~why ) She seems to enjoy agonizing over whether to split up with him. `00O t:  Does that bring anyone you know to mind? `01h a: ( ~yesanswer ) I don't understand continuing to see someone who doesn't excite you. `010 a: ( ~noanswer ) Good, I think it's a pointless sort of relationship. `00O b: ( ? << you [ ever never ] be in that >> ) `00Y t:  Colette is always fretting about her relationship. `01R a: ( ~why ) I think she'd like to dump him but is afraid of being alone.

It's so hot. `00= t:  The guy had been waiting thirty years for the lava to reach him. `01Z a: ( ~why ) The lava would flow towards his place, then stop for years, then flow some more. It depends on how active the vent is. `01H t:  He got to watch from a helicopter as his home burnt up and was overwhelmed. Really nothing left - just rock. `00W a: ( ~why ) That's what lava is when it cools: rock. `01F t:  I wonder if anything bad will happen today. What comes to mind when you hear the phrase natural disasters? `00^ a: ( ~why ) I'm interested in what you classify as a disaster. `00+ a: ( [ earthquake tremor quake ] ) Nowhere to go when that happens. `01R a: ( flood ) Even if you can swim it's hard to survive. Floods account for almost half of disaster deaths in the Americas. `01c a: ( [ landslip mudslide landslide ] ) Nasty, heavy, and impossible to deal with. `018 a: ( fire ) The way it uses up all the oxygen in the air makes it even worse. `00T a: ( lightning ) It's the ultimate electrocution. `012 a: ( [ tsunami tidal_wave ] ) Such an irresistible force coming at you. `017 a: ( [ waterspout hurricane ] ) It's impressive to see a whirlwind of water. `01i a: ( [ whirlwind tornado twister ] ) It's like the Wizard of Oz - whirling houses away. `01D a: ( << sea level rise >> ) Unless you have a floating house or one on stilts you are going to have to move. `01S a: ( << levee [ collapse fail leak overflow destroy ] >> ) I would hate to have just a wall between me and masses of water. `00! a: ( [ volcano lava eruption ] ) All you could do is run. `014 a: ( [ hail ice_storm ] ) That sort of wears you down until rescue comes. `010 a: ( iceberg ) The Titanic disaster was sort of man-made and natural. `01n a: ( [ meteor comet ] ) It's odd we have no defences against planet-killer rocks from space. `00W a: ( blizzard ) I'd hate to be lost out in the snow. `01& t: >WHATDISASTER ( ) I think lava, flood - things that can destroy your world are the worst. Though sometimes they look really cool on TV. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It's like a special effects movie but it's real. `00T t:  Have you ever experienced a natural disaster? `00T a: ( ~why ) I'd like to hear about what happened. `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) $nathappen = 1 Wow, what happened? `00D b: ( [ quake earthquake shake ] ) `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) You are lucky - they seem to be so common. `00- t: 7NOTME ( ) I've never lived through a disaster, thank goodness. `00# a: ( ~why ) It sounds like an awful thing to happen to you. `00- t: ( !$nathappen ) Do you worry about a disaster happening to you? `00Z a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you are a worrier or not. `018 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Sometimes I think about what would happen in an earthquake. `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) So you live in a safe place? `00T b: ( ~yesanswer ) That must be nice. Where is it? `014 b: ( ~noanswer ) You just don't like to think about bad things happening? `01v t: 9NOWORRY ( ) I don't worry about disasters. Against most of them there's nothing I can do anyway. `01u a: ( ~why ) They happen so unexpectedly and so forcefully that we are helpless in the face of them. `00X t:  What was the last natural disaster you saw on TV? `01t a: ( ~why ) You may well have seen more about disasters on TV than in real life. I hope so anyway. `017 a: ( [ earthquake tremor quake ] ) Makes the world feel unstable doesn't it! `00! a: ( flood ) Water seems so innocuous but is so powerful. `01t a: ( [ landslip mudslide landslide ] ) It's hard to think of a way to cope with the ground moving. `00= a: ( fire ) Firefighters are so heroic - usually it's a long battle. `01g a: ( lightning ) It happens all the time: somewhere is always being hit by lightning. `01f a: ( [ tsunami tidal_wave ] ) Must be so scary seeing a wall of water coming at you. `017 a: ( [ waterspout hurricane ] ) That just air can be so powerful is amazing. `015 a: ( [ whirlwind tornado twister ] ) I wouldn't want to be a storm chaser. `01k a: ( [ hail ice_storm ] ) I've heard of hail the size of baseballs - that could kill you. `00& a: ( blizzard ) I know it's dangerous but it looks so much fun! `00+ a: ( [ volcano lava eruption ] ) Beautiful, dramatic, and terrible. `00J a: ( iceberg ) They look so pretty too. `01@ a: ( [ meteor comet ] ) Always looks so terrifying, and rightly so. The great extinctions of history were probably caused by meteors. `00G t:  Are you prepared for a disaster? `01j a: ( ~why ) It's supposed to be a good idea to be ready for a brown-out of civilization. `00G a: ( what * I ) You need a full kit. `00t b: ( !? ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you have the full kit? `00t b: ( !? ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00T a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you have any of the full kit? `00t b: ( !? ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01H t:  You should have: first-aid, food, water, flashlight, hand-cranked radio, solar phone charger, space blanket. `00R a: ( ~why ) Those are the basics to stay alive. `01p t: 7READY ( ) We aren't prepared at our house. We just assume we won't be hit with a disaster. `01s a: ( ~why ) If you get into planning for it too much it gets depressing and could ruin your life. `01L t:  Statistically, you are more likely to commit suicide or fall to your death than be killed by a natural disaster. `017 a: ( ~why ) Don't ask me to explain statistics. I find it comforting though. `01f t:  Suppose there were a big disaster. Once the emergency food was gone - then what? `01o a: ( ~why ) You might need to protect yourself against scavengers after what little you have. `00X t:  Would you fight to take someone else's resources? `00% a: ( ~why ) It's good to examine your will to live sometimes. `01s a: ( ~yesanswer ) I don't want to live next door to you - unless I'm on your list of fave people. `01q a: ( [ ~dunno I_do_not_know ] ) Fair enough. You'd have to be in that situation to really know. `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) OK you can live near me - you're not a psychopath. `01G t: 7FIGHT ( ) I would fight to protect my home and my family and my friends, I guess.

You win. We lose. `01a t: 7WORST ( ) Any disaster that demolishes my clothes closet would be terrible. `014 a: ( ~why ) I've spent years putting together that collection of clothes. `01d t:  Should the world be more concerned about natural disasters or about terrorism? `00K a: ( ~why ) They are always in the news. `01g a: ( [ natural ~dunno ] ) Well, disasters seem to happen more than terrorist attacks. `01I a: ( [ terrorist terrorism ] ) If you prepare for terrorism then the terrorists have already won, my father says. `01o t: 8TERROR ( ) So far, natural disasters kill far more than terrorists. So I vote for nature. `01u a: ( ~why ) Prepare for what is most likely to happen not some rare event. Unless it's an asteroid. `00^ t:  Do you know anyone who could be called a natural disaster? `01T a: ( ~why ) There are characters around who are so accident prone or lack imagination for the consequences of their actions. `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you feel sorry for them or just avoid them? `014 b: ( [ ~emoapology sorry ] ) It is a terrible thing to be accident prone. `010 b: ( avoid ) My grandpaw says discretion is the better part of valor. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you - just be careful yourself. `01N t: 5BEN ( ) I immediately think of Ben. It seems as if everything he touches goes wrong on the largest scale possible. `00W a: ( ~why ) He overreaches in his quest for answers. `00W t:  What's the best disaster movie you've ever seen? `00? a: ( ~why ) Disaster movies are so awesome. I like watching them. `00! a: ( 2012 ) Seems like we'll see if its true soon enough. `01z a: ( The_Day_After_Tomorrow ) I'm still waiting to see if global warming exists and will be a bad thing. `00% a: ( Perfect_Storm ) My nightmare bathtub would be like that. `010 a: ( [ tornado twister ] ) Didn't end up as nice as the Wizard of Oz. `01T a: ( [ volcano Dante_'s_Peak ( Disaster Zone: Volcano in New York ) ] ) I would hate to singe my paws trying to escape lava. `012 a: ( Armageddon ) It will be really bad luck if we get hit by a meteor. `016 a: ( earthquake ) Fortunately only a few places are at risk of earthquakes. `011 t:  It's weird how we love to watch movies about such terrible events. `01& a: ( ~why ) Don't you think it's strange that we enjoy watching thousands of people perish in floods, or lava flows or other major events? `01* t: 7MOVIE ( ) I think I have to pick "2012" as my favorite: it has so many kinds of disasters, including floods, volcanoes and earthquakes. `01h a: ( ~why ) I love special effects on a massive scale and this one has that in spades. `00Y t:  Are there often natural disasters in your country? `00X a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you will experience one soon. `00Y a: ( ~yesanswer ) So you expect to be involved in one? `00W a: ( ~noanswer ) You live in a relatively safe area. `023 t: :FREQUENT ( ) I live in an area where there are occasional earthquakes and some strong winds but nothing destructive enough to take out a house. `01x a: ( ~why ) Just lucky I guess unless my grandparents had a secret agenda when they bought this house. `00$ t:  But if the sea level rose, we would soon be under water. `00X a: ( ~why ) We are only a few meters above sea level. `017 t:  Do you think natural disasters are happening more frequently these days? `01T a: ( ~why ) It might be something is changing in the planet or it might be a reporting artifact not really happening at all. `00J a: ( ~yesanswer ) Is it global warming? `00? a: ( ~noanswer ) So there's nothing to get extra concerned about? `01x t: 9GROWING ( ) I can't work out if there are more disasters or just more media outlets to cover them. `01I a: ( ~why ) How could you tell if it was just a media obsession with disasters to make the news more interesting? `01% t:  What with tweets, blogs, and Facebook all racing to bring us the news first, nothing happens without a firestorm of debate about it. `016 a: ( ~why ) People are always looking for the next big thing to talk about. `00= t:  Which do you think is worse, natural disasters or man made ones? `01c a: ( ~why ) Their effects may be similarly terrible but they don't feel the same. `01n a: ( natural ) Really! Is it the helplessness in the face of Nature that makes you say that? `019 a: ( [ man man_made ] ) Me too. Knowing someone caused it makes it feel worse. `00& t: 9MANMADE ( ) Man can outdo nature if he puts his mind to it. `021 a: ( ~why ) We have nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. And then there are all the nasties that aren't weapons but involve the same stuff. `01c t:  Would you move if you lived in a country where natural disasters were common? `00U a: ( ~why ) It might seem the logical thing to do. `00K a: ( ~yesanswer ) Where would you go to? `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) You would just take your chances then? `011 t: 6MOVE ( ) Disaster seems so unlikely, I see no reason to move away. `00% a: ( ~why ) Where is safe to move to? Nowhere that I know of. `00V t:  If a disaster hit your town, what would you do? `00Z a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you have ever thought about it. `00N a: ( [ run escape flee ] ) That might work. `00I a: ( die ) Sad, but entirely possible. `00S a: ( pray ) To make you feel better? !# get help `00+ a: ( [ seek get find ] * [ help assistance ] ) If any can be found. `01# a: ( [ cope live ] ) Yes, planning for disasters means you don't have to run around like a headless chicken when they actually happen. `01q t: 5IDO ( ) I'd flee if I knew a disaster were coming. Otherwise I'd just have to cope somehow. `00= a: ( ~why ) What else can one do? Curl up in a ball like a hedgehog? `00I t:  Are natural disasters acts of God? `00& a: ( ~why ) It's one way people try to explain why they happen. `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) Why is he so mean then? `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly, why would a supreme being be so mean? `01^ t: 5GOD ( ) Acts of God only happen if you're an insurance company. I don't think you need a supreme being to roll rocks down a hillside. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's an excessive explanation for a simple event. `01f t:  Do you think world governments do enough to help people after natural disasters? `00= a: ( ~why ) I wonder should be responsible for clearing up the mess. `00- a: ( ~yesanswer ) So the public don't need to worry about helping? `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) What would you have them do? `01~ t:  I wish we had "International Rescue" like in the old 'Thunderbirds' TV shows. People with special gear who are super-effective. `01A a: ( ~why ) Fast action is needed after a disaster - governments aren't famed for their speedy reactions. `00U t:  Being super cool and handsome also helps ^":)" `015 a: ( ~why ) Don't you think anything is better with good-looking rescuers? `01B t:  I do fundraising after most big disasters to send money or teams of helpers to assist in the recovery. `01g a: ( ~why ) Money is the most useful thing to buy whatever is needful to help people. `01o t: 6GOVT ( ) Governments never seem to do enough. If they did, my efforts wouldn't be needed. `01- a: ( ~why ) Just look at the lingering mess after any disaster - governments seem to lose interest after the light of publicity has moved on. `00X t:  What would happen if a giant comet hit the Earth? `00= a: ( ~why ) It's the ultimate disaster, shouldn't we think about it! `01c t: 8METEOR ( ) It would be a cat-aclysm; we would all become extinct really fast. `01A a: ( ~why ) It would be like exploding hundreds of nuclear bombs all at once. We'd have a nuclear winter. `01K t:  I can't help watching when some major disasters happen: like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and Indonesia. `00W a: ( ~why ) They have a horrible fascination for me. `02n a: ( [ Indonesia Sumatra Haiti ] ) I'm always saddened by the catastrophes in these areas. All those islands and cute villages get flooded and people lose their homes. `02D a: ( ![ Indonesia Sumatra Haiti ] [ Fukushima Daiichi TEPCO Japan earthquake quake nuclear ] *~2 > ) Don't tell me you haven't heard about it? The quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster? `01! t:  It was terrible to see the aftermath of the devastation and nuclear crisis in Japan. Many people lost everything but their hope. `01E a: ( ~why ) They could only hope things would get better. They had no home and no prospect of returning home. `00? t:  What do you think, is it safe now around the Fukushima plant? `010 a: ( ~why ) It's the question all those made homeless have to answer. `00Y a: ( [ ~noanswer never ] ) Perhaps one day it will be? `02k a: 9ITSSAFE ( ~yesanswer ) They've said it on the news, right? I saw a video of one of the politicians drinking a glass of water from Fukushima. Boy was he nervous! `01B a: 7FSAFE ( [ maybe ~emomaybe suppose ] ) It's hard to say whether it's safe around there. Time will tell. `01R t:  When a catastrophe occurs people need all the help they can get. Have you ever donated money to disaster relief funds? `01a a: ( ~why ) I'm wondering if you see it as something you should be involved in. `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) I'm glad.

Ultra-pasteurised stuff just tastes slimy to me. `01& a: ( ~why ) I think it's cos its over-cooked and has lost all the good enzymes and bacteria that help us digest it.

Though I might do it if I thought no one was looking. `00^ t: ( !$nomilk ) Milk needs extra cream to be really delicious. `00R a: ( ~why ) That's the way it's supposed to be. `01A t:  I tried raw milk once - it was so rich and tasty. Now I mix cream into milk to recapture that flavor. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It restores the natural creamy flavor of milk. `01t t: 5RAW ( ) Have you ^if 00f( $nomilk ) 00k{ at least } 00r else ( 1 ) 00b { } 004 tried raw milk? `01n a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you've experienced it - as it's hard to come by in many areas. `013 a: ( ~noanswer ) It's actually very good for you and tastes much better. `01J t:  Raw milk is illegal in most of the US, but in France is sold from vending machines. What's wrong with America? `01L a: ( ~why ) I'd like raw milk to be available everywhere. But America thinks it is easier to have germs in raw milk. `01k t:  I like drinks based on milk too: hot chocolate with extra whipped cream is wonderful. `00P a: ( ~why ) The combo of cream and chocolate. `00P t:  Do you like milk shakes or hot chocolate? `01K a: ( ~why ) I find it hard to choose between them. Not that I have to. Perhaps it reveals something deep about you. `00L a: ( milk_shake ) Good choice for summer. `00S a: ( hot_chocolate ) Yum, great in cold weather. `00J a: ( ~noanswer ) But they're delicious! `01F t:  The ultimate drink is the milk shake. Plain vanilla is superb but I also like chocolate and banana shakes. `00= a: ( ~why ) A little variety is good, variations on a classic theme. `00$ t:  For a touch of exotica I sometimes have a coconut shake. `00~ a: ( ~why ) Just for variety, and cos it tastes so good. `01D t:  Then there are the milk and cream containing things like ice cream and Gelato - more yumminess to enjoy. `00B a: ( ~why ) Why not enjoy them? `01T t:  I like coconut milk. I prefer it in food rather than as a drink. Maybe the heat involved in canning ruins it as a drink? `01R a: ( ~why ) I think coconut milk is better as an addition to a dish rather than as a straight drink. It is very very rich. `01h t:  I've tried coconut water but was not impressed - where is all the creamy goodness? `01E a: ( ~why ) It lacks fat so I'm not very keen on it. Now if it was mixed with coconut milk it might be great. `00x t:  Do you drink tap water? `00% a: ( ~why ) Many people avoid it, thinking it's contaminated. `00R a: ( ~noanswer ) Are you worried it's polluted? `01m a: ( ~yesanswer ) Does this mean you haven't swallowed all the fakery around bottled water? `01M b: ( fakery ) Most bottled water is just repackaged tap water. And pure mountain streams aren't that pure these days. `019 t:  I prefer to drink regular tap water although I'm happier if it's filtered. `010 a: ( ~why ) I prefer my water without fluoridation and rust and such. `01c ?: ( << how filter water >> ) Water filters do the job. Whole house or tap-based. `01q t:  Bottled water is silly especially as the plastic bottles can make the water actually toxic. `01x a: ( ~why ) Bi-phenols leach out of the plastic into the water and get concentrated in your body. Ugh. `01U t:  It's against my principles to drink stuff in plastic. The waste bottles end up in huge gyres in the middle of the oceans. `00M a: ( ~why ) The currents carry them there. `00N t: ( !$nodrinkcoffee ) Do you drink coffee? `014 a: ( ~why ) It's a common stimulant, I like it I wondered if you did too. `00T a: ( ~yesanswer ) Black, or with sugar and cream? `00K b: ( black ) Black is too strong for me. `00Z b: ( !no cream ) As a cat, of course I will want cream. `017 b: ( !no sugar ) If you are going to sugar it, you might as well drink cola. `015 a: ( ~noanswer ) So the thought of going to Starbucks doesn't turn you on. `01v t:  I know I'm addicted to coffee: I get grouchy if I miss my cup of coffee at the start of the day. `00! a: ( ~why ) I need the caffeine kick to wake my brain up. `00= t:  If I drink too many cups of coffee I get super-active and jumpy. `00N a: ( ~why ) The caffeine overstimulates me. `01! t: ( !$nodrinkcoffee ) My whiskers start twitching which makes me feel like the room is expanding and contracting - not good at all. `00% a: ( ~why ) I don't like the sensation. I suppose some might. `00O t:  Do you drink soft drinks like Coca-Cola? `01L a: ( ~why ) Another very popular thing to do but I don't understand why it's so ubiquitous when it's so bad for you. `013 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Oh, but they are revoltingly sweet and so bad for you. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Good for you! They are really bad for you. `023 t: 6COLA ( ) I don't like colas. At school they showed us a demo of teeth in a cola glass. The teeth became discolored nasty stumps in a few hours. `00Z a: ( ~why ) The acids in the cola destroy tooth enamel. `01a t:  So now I won't touch anything like that. I'm proud of my sharp white teeth. `00# a: ( ~why ) A cat needs good teeth to eat and to look good. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01h u: ( what be raw_milk ) Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized or homogenized. `01t u: ( what be coconut_milk ) It's a juice made by squeezing the shredded white insides of coconuts. `01+ u: ( << what be gyre >> ) It's a sort of flat whirlpool in the middle of the ocean.

Ugh. `01j t:  I don't like the idea of mercury and other nasties ending up in my food and my body. `019 a: ( ~why ) Mercury is found a lot in the ocean along with other heavy metals. `01W t:  Oceana's 'Stop Seafood Contamination' campaign is working to convince chlorine plants to switch to mercury-free technology. `00L a: ( ~why ) To keep it out of the oceans. `00= t:  Did you know half of the fish we eat come from farmed fisheries? `00# a: ( ~why ) It's cheaper to farm it than to hunt wild fish. `01r t:  It takes 5 pounds of wild fish to feed 1 pound of farmed salmon. That makes me very nervous. `00K a: ( ~why ) We may run out of wild fish. `00! t:  Any other ideas on what we can do to help the planet? `00! a: ( ~why ) I'd love to find something really good to do. `00$ a: ( [ energy power ] ) Good plan.

Governmental law is what is needed. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `02j ?: ( what be fluoride ) Fluoride is added to water to prevent tooth decay. Most countries don't use it. There is little evidence that it does anything useful. Ugh. `01e u: ( what be biochar ) Biochar is like charcoal but produced at lower temperatures. `01- a: ( !? ) It stores carbon in the soil, increasing fertility, keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere, and makes a fuel while it is being produced. `014 ?: ( << what you [ do dispose ] [ garbage waste ] >> ) ^reuse ( DISPOSE ) `01T ?: ( !idea << you [ attitude feel ~like ] [ help save healthy heal ] [ planet ecology world Earth ] >> ) ^reuse ( ATTITUDE ) `01S ?: ( << you activist >> ) I don't consider myself an activist.

There used to be 100,000 in 1900. `00@ a: ( ~why ) They were hunted and their habitats destroyed. `01U t:  Partly people kill them because tigers do eat dozens of people each year. I'd be scared if a tiger was loose around here. `00J a: ( ~why ) They are dangerous killers. `01^ t:  Partly they kill tigers because their fur is so valuable as exclusive clothing. A poor person can make a fortune from one tiger skin. `01N a: ( ~why ) If you could live for a year or more on one skin wouldn't you kill a dangerous predator and take its skin. `01A t:  Conservation projects are failing because the demand for dead tigers, mostly from China, is so great. `00O a: ( ~why ) They use them in their medicine. `01L t:  Trying to keep tigers alive is very difficult as the places where they live are full of desperately poor people. `01u a: ( ~why ) Which are more important people or tigers? It's a tough call if your a conservationist. `01$ t:  The only thing that makes sense to me is to give tigers a cash value through eco-tourism.

Win-win. `01$ t:  I contribute to saving big exotic cats of all sorts helped by charities like Big Cat Rescue in Florida.

Alone in the world.

We cats are a long lived species. `01s t:  We'll have to visit great-great grandpaw extra so he doesn't get lonely now his wife is dead. `01n a: ( ~why ) Without his life partner he is living alone.

A sister, maybe. `01r a: ;NOBROTHER ( ~why ) Brothers are just something to fight with. Sisters can share experiences. `01@ u: ( name * run * family ) I think it's fine to use historical names.

" all " 00P t: ( ^stdblock ( $noladygaga ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `020 t: <MUSTFOLLOW ( ) I love it when Lady Gaga tweets about new clothes and jewelry. And I follow Georgia May Jagger's tweets, she's always trendy. `01S a: ( ~why ) I'm always interested in tweets about wild fashion statements. As a Jagger she's always wearing something wild. `01T t:  Lady Gaga has some extraordinary dresses. Nothing is too bizarre for her! What's your take on her style, do you like it? `013 a: ( ~why ) I wonder if we share the same thoughts about Gaga's fashion. `011 a: ( !eat [ raw meat flesh beef ] ) That meat dress was utterly gross. `01% a: 6GAGA ( [ ~yesanswer ~favorite ~goodness hot sexy crazy cool ] ) Isn't she brilliant? She can put on anything and still look herself. `01d a: ( [ ~noanswer ~badness ] ) Yes, she can be quite bold at times. Maybe too bold? `01? t:  I wish people got as upset with someone wearing fur as when they saw Lady Gaga wearing a meat dress. Animals without fur look like that. `00# a: ( ~why ) I'm strongly against using real fur in fashion. `00+ t: 6MEAT ( ) There were some chilly responses to Gaga's meat dress. `00C a: ( ? were ) Yes. ^gambit ( ~ ) `01G t:  Ellen DeGeneres' reaction to the meat dress was nicely done. Gentle but got across that she didn't like it. `00O a: ( ~why ) ^callstory ( ~gaga_dress_story ) `00= a: ( ? [ ~yes what she_say more ] ) ^callstory ( ~gaga_dress_story ) `01q a: ( ?

She busts out the craziest hats ever. Have you noticed? `01Y a: ( [ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) They couldn't go unnoticed right? Oh it'd be really awesome if I could design some hats with her. `01Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Wow, I'm amazed! There are so many peculiar things about her that things like a telephone hat pass by unnoticed! `01? t:  I expected another hat creation for the Grammys but instead she wore a fishnet mask. It was a custom Chanel creation. Made me so hungry. `00S a: ( ~why ) She reminded me of a big tasty fish. `00f a: ( !? ) `01D t:  Anyway her albums are epic. No wonder she smashed the world record with 20 million followers on Twitter. `00f a: ( !? ) `00@ t: ( ^fresh ( ~celebrities ) ) ^calltopic ( ~celebrities ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00T u: ( << Lady_Gaga meat dress >> ) ^reuse ( MEAT ) `01f ?: ( << you ~like Lady_Gaga [ style appearance fashion outfit ] >> ) ^reuse ( GAGA ) `011 ?: ( << you [ think opinion say ~like ] Lady_Gaga >> ) ^reuse ( GAGA ) `00P ?: ( << you wear meat dress >> ) Ugh.

It was about fighting for our rights. `024 t:  "If we don't stand up for what we believe in, if we don't fight for our rights, soon we're gonna have as much rights as the meat on our bones" . `01L t:  Gaga also said: "And I am not a piece of meat" as she held up her meat bikini cover for Japanese Vogue Magazine. `00S t:  Then Ellen gave her a kale bikini and skirt. `00Y a: ( ~why ) As a suggestion for her next bikini shoot. `01h t:  They clearly hit if off cos Gaga's been back on the show lots of times since then. `011 t:  I can't wait to see what Lady Gaga will do next!

Lying can get complicated. `01+ a: ( ~why ) You have to remember all your lies so you can stay consistent with them. It's living a lie - that gets to be a lot of remembering. `00D t:  Have you told any lies today? `01y a: ( ~why ) I'm curious how commonly you lie and it should be easier to remember lies you've just told. `00H a: ( ~yesanswer ) Who did you lie to? `00G b: ( ~friend ) Did they believe you? `01j b: ( [ family ~family_members ] ) Will they find you out?

No of course not. And liars get caught out enough so people know they are liars. `01# t:  I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself. `00R a: ( ~why ) I wanted it to be a designer dress. `01O t:  I wish I'd told the truth then I could have taken the credit for it - maybe I'd have been discovered as a designer! `01A a: ( ~why ) People get discovered on the street all the time. Although usually it's models who get found. `01w t:  Why did I lie? I felt it was cheap to wear a homemade dress. But really it showed I was creative. `012 a: ( ~why ) It takes imagination to design and make something yourself. `00A t:  Can lying be a good thing? `013 a: ( ~why ) It's interesting to see if a bad thing can have a good side. `00? a: ( ~yesanswer ) You feel you are protecting someone's feelings? `00X a: ( ~noanswer ) You feel pure truth is always right? `01% a: ( [ depends sometimes occasionally occasion ] ) Yes, some lies are bad but some help avoid embarrassment and are socially acceptable. `01V t: 9GOODLIE ( ) It seems like lying can be good sometimes, but I'd be interested in trying a society that actually never lied. `021 a: ( ~why ) Like in the Ricky Gervais film 'The Invention of Lying' where he was the first to lie. No one else could tell anything but the truth. `00C t:  Who lies more, men or women? `00U a: ( ~why ) It's an interesting demographic split. `00! a: ( ~male ) Correct, about a third more lies than women. `00C a: ( ~female ) No, men lie more. `01u t: 8MENLIE ( ) Apparently men lie more than women. Men lied most often about their drinking habits. `011 a: ( ~why ) To conceal things they thought others would disapprove of. `00E t:  What do you usually lie about? `00H a: ( ~why ) I'm looking for patterns. `018 a: ( [ drink alcohol booze ] ) So you say "I didn't have that much to drink." `016 a: ( [ problem issue difficulty ] ) So you say "Nothing's wrong, I'm fine." `016 a: ( ~phonelist ) So you say "I had no signal" or was it "My battery died?" `00* a: ( [ depart set set_out start ] ) So you say "I'm on the way." `00^ a: ( [ where not_there ] ) So you say: "I'm stuck in traffic." `01i a: ( [ fit clothes clothing dress skirt blouse ] ) So you say: "You look good in that." `00* a: ( [ call message ] ) So you say: "Sorry, I missed your call." `00~ a: ( [ weight diet ] ) So you say: "You've lost weight." `013 a: ( [ gift present ] ) So you say: "It's just what I've always wanted." `01p a: ( [ lose misplace missing ] ) So you say: "I don't know where it is, I haven't touched it." `015 a: ( [ buy purchase price cost ] ) So you say: "It wasn't that expensive." `00Q a: ( ~sex ) So you say: "I've got a headache." `00P t:  Has a lie someone told you ever hurt you? `00? a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you've seen the other side of lies. `00v a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. `01c a: ( ~noanswer ) Does that mean you are tough-hearted or no one ever lies to you? `01# t: <LIEHURTYOU ( ) A friend once said she'd loved a gift I gave her. Then I saw another friend of hers wearing it. Regifting is harsh. `01c a: ( ~why ) It means the person you gave it to didn't like it. And got rid of it. `00B t:  What do you think of liars? `01r a: ( ~why ) People can be very judgemental about lying. Especially if they think they don't lie. `01z a: ( [ times reason situations ] ) There usually seem good reasons to lie to protect someone's feelings. `00D a: ( !? not * ~goodness ) Severe. `012 a: ( !?

We'd better talk about something else." ) `01u t: 9OPINION ( ) I don't mind people who tell lies to spare feelings. I just don't like bigger lies. `01C a: ( ~why ) It makes it hard to know what's real and it means they don't care about the people around them. `00M t:  Have you ever lied in a job interview? `01T a: ( ~why ) It's a high pressure situation where you want to look your best - so it's tempting to lie about your background. `015 a: ( << [ not never ] [ done had ] >> ) What about in a teacher interview? `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) I wonder if they'll ever find out? `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) A dangerous place to lie, they might check up on you. `01f a: ( [ kid child young school student ] ) So what if a teacher asked you a question? `01E t:  I once told a teacher a dog ate my homework. She didn't believe me but actually it was nastier than that. `00U a: ( ~why ) I didn't have any homework to hand in. `00M a: ( [ what happen occur ] ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00R t:  I dropped my homework and a dog peed on it. `019 a: ( ~why ) It's what dogs do. I didn't want to pick it up so I left it there. `00F t:  Do you think white lies are OK? `00! a: ( ~why ) These are lies that many people think are OK. `01a a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^reuse ( BENEFITS ) If it protects someone's feelings its OK. `01j a: ( ~noanswer ) ^reuse ( BENEFITS ) If it's just to make you look better it's not good. `00^ t: :BENEFITS ( ) I think it depends who benefits from the lie. `00U a: ( ~why ) A kind lie is better than a cruel lie. `01! t: 8WHYLIE ( ) I think guys lie to look better in the eyes of others. Women lie to spare feelings and make other people feel better. `01e a: ( ~why ) Women care more about relationships. Guys care more about their status. `016 ?: ( << [ why what ] ~female lie >> ) Women lie to make other people happy. `01g ?: ( << [ why what ] ~male lie >> ) Men lie to make themselves look better to others. `01C t:  Tom tells tall tales all the time to look good. Whereas when I lie it's to protect a friend's feelings. `01a a: ( ~why ) Well, perhaps I lie to dramatize the difference between me and Tom. `00v t:  How often do you lie? `00@ a: ( ~why ) The more you lie the easier it gets I imagine. `00+ a: ( ~dunno ) They just trip off your tongue without your noticing? `01D a: ( [ ~always ~often daily weekly many ] ) You just look people in the eye and tell them whatever you like? `00# a: ( [ ~rarely monthly ~noanswer ] ) I should believe that? `01H t: 6WHEN ( ) I've lied about my cell phone being 'off' or 'lost charge' or 'lost' or 'left at a friend's house'. `00v a: ( ~why ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01c t:  I didn't want to tell my parents I was out with Tom and they kept calling me. `00V a: ( ~why ) They think I see a bit too much of Tom. `00O t:  What's the biggest lie you've ever told? `00- a: ( ~why ) I thought you'd remember if you'd told a real whopper. `00H a: ( not remember ) You tell so many? `00@ a: ( [ wrong fine good ] ) But something was really wrong. `00T a: ( [ suits_you good_on_you ] ) It looked awful. `00# a: ( ~phonelist ) Right, you didn't want to take that call. `00I a: ( meant to ) I wanted to avoid you. `00& a: ( [ cheap expensive sale bargain free ] ) It cost a fortune. `00& a: ( traffic ) You mean you're not coming or being really late. `00Z a: ( drink ) You are drunk and staying for more drinks. `00+ a: ( know where ) I moved it and now can't remember where I put it. `00R a: ( headache ) I don't want to play right now. `00D a: ( throw ) I did throw it away. `00X a: ( << missed call >> ) I don't want to talk to you. `023 t: 8BIGLIE ( ) I once told my mother that a designer purse I'd bought 'wasn't that expensive'. But she found the credit card bill and hit the roof. `01q a: ( ~why ) I'm not allowed to spend that much on frivolous items. So she knew I'd lied to her. `01x a: ( cash ) Cash would have been safer. But I was hardly expecting her to look so closely at the bill. `00Z t:  My allowance got frozen 'til the card was paid off. `011 a: ( ~why ) To punish me and make me learn that lying doesn't pay off. `00L t:  Would you ever lie in a court of law? `01h a: ( ~why ) It's a legal situation where you could be punished if discovered in a lie. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) Really? ^reuse ( PERJURY ) `019 a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either, that would be wrong. Anyway ... ^reuse ( PERJURY ) `01g t: 9PERJURY ( ) I'd be scared to lie in court - that's perjury. You could go to jail. `01W a: ( ~why ) There have to be recriminations for lying in court or criminals would do it all the time - they probably do anyway. `00K t:  Could you beat a lie detection test? `00$ a: ( ~why ) It's supposed to enable one to divine the truth. `00P a: ( ~yesanswer ) You are one cool character. `00C a: ( ~noanswer ) ^reuse ( BEAT ) `01x t: 6BEAT ( ) I could probably beat a lie detector. After all cats don't have sweaty palms like humans. `00P a: ( ~why ) It's the fur, and we don't sweat. `00Z t:  What would you do if someone spread lies about you? `00X a: ( ~why ) Lies can generate some negative emotions. `01e a: ( << lie [ back them ] >> ) Muddying the waters so no one can tell what is true? `01a a: ( [ clear reputation truth ] ) It's hard to fight mud-slinging, some sticks. `01w a: ( [ sue court law prosecute arrest libel slander ] ) Isn't it expensive and difficult to sue them? `01G t: 8SPREAD ( ) Ideally I'd get them to recant but in practice I would have to ignore the lie and just carry on. `00K a: ( ~why ) Revenge can get out of hand. `00U t:  Have you ever cheated on or lied to a partner? `00& a: ( ~why ) I wonder if that's more serious than everyday lies. `00V a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did they find out? What happened? `00* a: ( ~noanswer ) You are straightforward and honest. I like you. `00q b: ( ? you ) No way! `018 t: 9PARTNER ( ) I've never cheated on my boyfriends. I can't even imagine it. `00Q a: ( ~why ) I'm a straightforward sort of cat. `00N t:  Do you feel guilty when you tell a lie? `01k a: ( ~why ) I understand that's the line between a socialized person and a social misfit. `00J a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. ^gambit ( ~ ) `012 a: ( ~noanswer ) You should go play card games where lying is an asset. `00% t: 8GUILTY ( ) I don't like lying. I'm afraid I'll be caught. `01l a: ( ~why ) I'm liable to forget what I said. And I'm always chatting to different people. `00W t:  Have you ever been found out when telling a lie? `00M a: ( ~why ) I imagine it feels really bad. `00? a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did you feel bad or just hated being found out? `00^ a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you. It feels horrible to be found out. `00Z t:  I already told you the time my mom caught me lying. `00S a: ( ~why ) Just so you can see I'm not perfect. `00w t:  Is exaggeration lying? `00Q a: ( ~why ) It's hard to even see it as a lie. `01H a: ( ~yesanswer ) A lot of my friends have exaggerated how good their grades at school are - it's a sort of lie. `01I a: ( ~noanswer ) So if you said you'd gotten much higher marks in an exam than you actually did that would be OK? `01D t: <EXAGGERATE ( ) I don't think exaggeration or tall tales are lies. They are just extensions of the truth. `01a a: ( ~why ) Cos I use them a lot and I don't like to think of myself as a liar. `00% t:  How can you tell when people are being truthful with you? `01D a: ( ~why ) It's an important social skill.

I suppose I might if I wanted to support some special cause. `01C a: ( ~why ) I don't feel the odds are worth it. I'm not a gambler. I'd rather just give money to the cause. `01w a: ( ~example ) Lotteries support charities and other good causes. Buying a ticket helps their cause. `00+ t:  In France the Lottery is called LOTO and is mostly state owned. `01e a: ( ~why ) Lotteries are a way for the state to make money, usually from the poor. `00S t:  It's motto is "Chance belongs to everyone" . `00R a: ( ~why ) It has a nice socialist ring to it. `01E t:  They've paid out more than 4 billion Francs in prizes, making thousands of people into multimillionaires. `012 a: ( ~why ) They calculate the win in Francs not Euros. Bit of a cheat. `01? t:  It works much like everywhere: choose 6 numbers from 1 to 49.

I guess he exceeded the odds. Or cheated somehow. `00A a: ( ~why ) They did the math. `01u t:  He spent 1,000 euros on tickets before he won the second time. But he won back 3 million euros. `00@ a: ( ~why ) 3,000% return on investment sounds good to me. `01! t:  According to what I've read, the first lotteries were in ancient China, and helped fund government projects like the Great Wall. `014 a: ( ~why ) It's a more popular way to raise funds than putting up taxes. `01Q t:  Governments have been raking in the cash ever since. Not surprising - lotteries have the lowest pay-back rate around. `00N a: ( ~why ) It's a great way to make money. `01j t:  When you play casinos a lot, on average over time they give back 9/10 of your money. `01z a: ( ~why ) They want you to feel you can be lucky.

I wondered what you thought of it. `015 a: ( barter ) I'm sure bartering works but must be tricky for small items. `01E b: ( ~why ) You'd have to have equivalent small stuff to barter with.

What is it? `01y t:  I like to see movies in a cinema - it's much more immersive and real to me that way. How about you? `01d a: ( ~why ) I want to know if we share that love of theaters.

And then it became a tradition to go every weekend with my parents. `01t a: ( ~why ) They like movies too and mostly managed to find something we could all stand to watch. `01c a: ( << what [ see watch ~category ] >> ) We saw cartoons and Disney-type movies. `028 a: ( << what be [ favorite best ] >> ) I loved Disney's Snow White. Not like the really dark one "Snow White and the Huntsman" .

A cat is proud of her teeth and won't do anything to jeopardise their health. `026 a: ( [ chocolate candy ] ) I won't touch chewy candy or sweets - cat's teeth aren't made for chewing and they get all gunged up with soft chewy stuff. `01m a: ( [ ~noanswer nothing ] ) Good for you - better to get into the movie instead of eating. `01I a: 5EAT ( !? ) A cat is very proud of her teeth and won't do anything to jeopardise their health. So cola is out. `01m b: ( !? ) Same for chewy candy - cat's teeth aren't made for chewing and get all gunged up. `01Y t: 9POPCORN ( ) Popcorn smells good but I know it's just fake synthetic smell so I avoid it. I'd rather eat straight butter. Yum. `01c a: ( ~why ) I don't think eating artificial chemical flavors is good for my body. `00G t:  What kind of movies do you like? `00U a: ( ~why ) I'm trying to learn about your tastes. `00Q a: ( [ not none never hate ] ) ^reuse ( HATE ) `013 a: ( [ ~movie_genres porn adult dirty ] ) ^respond ( ~moviegenre_react ) `01r a: ( [ all every ] ) Are you claiming to have no taste, or just that you'll go and see anything? `014 t:  I love romance and romantic comedy films - I'm such a romance addict. `01d a: ( ~why ) Perhaps it's cos I'm hoping for my romance with Tom to be the big one. `00K t:  Do you have a favorite romance film? `00* a: ( ~why ) It's telling which film in a genre is your favorite. `00N a: ( ~yesanswer !%more ) What is it called? `00L b: ( * ) Tell me why you like it so much. `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer %more ) Tell me why you like it so much. `01b a: ( [ none ~noanswer ] ) You'd rather I didn't talk about them at all I'll bet. `00J a: ( ~movie ) ^respond ( ~movie_react ) `00+ t: 9ROMANCE ( ) My favorite romance film is "Shakespeare in Love" . `01g a: 9WHYLIKE ( ~why ) It's intelligent and cultured while still being full of romance. `01L a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) The film centers around the forbidden love of William Shakespeare and a noble woman. `00V a: ( what * you * like * about ) ^reuse ( WHYLIKE ) `01J t:  It has Gwyneth, beautiful costumes and the story that inspired Romeo and Juliet, my favorite Shakespeare play. `01a a: ( ~why ) I like the notion of star-crossed lovers struggling to be together. `00R t:  What about a favorite romantic comedy film? `00Y a: ( ~why ) It's a slightly different take on romance. `00! a: ( [ ~noanswer none ] ) Really?

I love tales of mistaken identity like this one. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It's the 'star-crossed' thing again I suppose. `01! a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) It's an oldie. Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the Internet. `01u t:  Watching in a good rom-com is one of my favorite feel-good experiences, next to being with Tom. `00* a: ( ~why ) You know it's all going to work out fine in the end. `00V t: :RECENTLY ( ) What movie have you seen recently? `014 a: ( ~why ) The latest seen film is surely the one you remember the best. `00J a: ( ~movie ) ^respond ( ~movie_react ) `00F a: ( ~propername ) Did you like it? `00A t:  Who's your favorite actor? `00W a: ( ~why ) I want to see if we share any favorites. `01d a: ( _~actor ) ^query ( direct_vo ? star '_0 1 ) '_0 was in @0subject , wasn't he? `00M a: ( _~actress ) '_0 is a girl, not a guy. `00C t:  Who's your favorite actress? `00- a: ( ~why ) I want to know if we admire any of the same actresses. `01g a: ( _~actress ) ^query ( direct_vo ? star '_0 1 ) '_0 was in @0subject , wasn't she? `00K a: ( _~actor ) '_0 is a guy, not a girl. `01+ t:  There are some great book-to-film projects coming up soon. Some of the best movies are adapted from books. But the books are still better. `01R a: ( ~why ) Imagination is better than a movie any day. And books have more detail about the inner life of the characters. `01w t:  Do you have a favorite book that got made into a movie or a favorite movie that came from a book? `01r a: ( ~why ) I like that sort of mental 3D effect you get from the overlap of a book and a movie. `00J a: ( ~movie ) ^respond ( ~movie_react ) `00V a: ( ~yesanswer %more ) ^next ( INPUT ) ^refine ( ) `00J b: ( ~movie ) ^respond ( ~movie_react ) `00y b: ( * ) ^retry ( SENTENCE ) `00G a: ( ~yesanswer > ) Cool.

That was a terrific set of films. `01Y a: ( ~why ) The books were brilliant and so were the films. They each illuminated the other. Looking forward to The Hobbit films. `01T t:  I loved the films made from the Harry Potter books. Now I'm waiting for the rest of the "Hunger Games" films to be made. `01q a: ( ~why ) Good books will hopefully become great films - doesn't always work that way though. `01b t:  I liked the fantasy thriller 'Beautiful Creatures' that is being filmed now. `00C a: ( ~why ) It's so imaginative. `01% a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) Supernatural star-crossed romance, a small town full of secrets, and a dash of Southern gothic intrigue. `01Q t: 7HANNA ( ) Then there's the new Stephanie Meyer's book-to-film project 'The Host' with Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. `00S a: ( ~why ) There is an unearthly beauty to her. `02c a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) Our world has been invaded. Humans become hosts, their minds taken over while their bodies remain intact. But love triumphs. `00T t:  All us Twilight fans will go to see that one. `01H a: ( ~why ) They'll want to see if its as good as Twilight was - not that it was really that good in my opinion. `00T t:  Did you see Saoirse in 'Hanna'? I liked that. `013 a: ( ~why ) It was more of that haunting beauty and dramatic situations. `01o t:  I had to bail on the Saoirse film 'The Lovely Bones' - it was just too disturbing for me. `01s a: ( ~why ) Child molesters give me the creeps. And killers on top of it - no I couldn't take it. `01- t:  I couldn't watch 'The Atonement' film of Saoirse's either. I doesn't know how she can sleep at night after playing such disturbing roles. `00^ a: ( ~why ) You'd think the characters would stay in her mind. `00S t: ( ^fresh ( ~oscars ) ) ^calltopic ( ~oscars ) `00w t:  Do you like 3D movies? `01& a: ( [ ~goodness ~yesanswer ] ) You have better eyes than I do - they give me a headache.

They give me a headache. `00? t: ( !$no3d ) Do you think 3D movies are worth their extra price? `01A a: ( ~why ) People seem split over whether it's worth paying extra, and having to wear the silly glasses. `01! a: 43D ( [ ~yesanswer ~noanswer 3D 3-D ] ) I hate 3D movies. They say the 3D craze comes every 10 years. Is it worth bothering with? `01# b: ( !? ) In the final Harry Potter, the people looked like cardboard cutouts. The background was all fuzzy. And it gave me eyestrain. `01M t: ( !$no3d ) I really enjoyed "Hugo" , the Scorsese film, despite its being in 3D which usually gives me a headache. `00H a: ( ~why ) I think it's the glasses. `01l t:  I'm looking forward to seeing young Asa Butterfield in his next film: "Ender's Game" . `00T a: ( ~why ) He looks well cast for the character. `010 t:  Ender is one of my favorite books being made into a film at last. `01v a: ( ~why ) I think it'll need lots of special effects for all the zero-gee stuff.

It's an oldie but a goodie. `01w u: ( Amelie ) In French but so amusing and touching as the heroine tries to help people fall in love. `01Y u: ( Roman_Holiday ) Films with princesses are good but why would a princess want to escape her life to run away with a reporter? `01F u: ( Casablanca ) It's a lovely film but so sad. I don't think I could handle things the way Rick and Ilsa do. `00# u: ( Shakespeare_in_Love ) Gwyneth in costume - perfection. `01y u: ( Ghost ) I like it cos it's so sad and so weirdly exciting.

It just lacked chemistry between the lead actors. `01# u: ( Red_Riding_Hood ) I'd thought this might be magical but found it a bit grim and violent. Why does Seyfried make such lemon films? `01i u: ( Jane_Eyre ) Lot's of costumes to enjoy although so many drab colors in those days. `01n u: ( Beastly ) This was disturbing with its weird disfiguring-tattoo special effect make-up. `01f a: ( !? ) But it was a good film and I did love Mary-Kate Olsen as the wicked witch. `01J u: ( Water_For_Elephants ) Despite it having delicious Robert Pattinson in it I found the elephants the best part. `01O u: ( Godfather ) Did you know Don Corleone's cat was a stray?

I was scared at first, then exhilarated! `00H u: ( Forrest_Gump ) I lahk it a loht. `01o u: ( Usual_Suspects ) Tom and I were shocked by the ending. I won't spoil it for you, though! `01l u: ( [ Judgement_Day Terminator ] ) Too much violence for me. Too much, well, terminating. `01F u: ( Toy_Story ) I liked it.

Almost as cute as a cat! `01j u: ( Gladiator ) I loved Russel Crowe in that. But don't tell Tom. He might get jealous. `01W u: ( Monty_Python ) Monty Python's awesome. And if I was John Cleese, I wouldn't have taken that dead parrot back for a refund. `01c u: ( up *~2 > ) Did you know cats have tear ducts? That movie is proof that I do. `00? u: ( Jaws ) It's my biggest nightmare: a fish that can bite back! `01p u: ( Black_Swan ) Natalie Portman did an amazing job in that movie.

A great way to work up your appetite! `01a u: ( Good_Will_Hunting ) I loved it. Matt Damon is very handsome for a non-cat. `01B u: ( Princess_Bride ) I love it. It's super romantic. Don't tell anyone, but Tom cries when he watches it. `01u u: ( Rocky ) I sometimes whistle the Rocky theme while I shop. As inspiration for the battle ahead. `016 u: ( Hugo ) One of my favorites this year, although 3D gives me a headache. `01p u: ( Catwoman ) The movie didn't do her justice. If they reboot it, I'd love to play the part! `00^ u: ( Lassie ) I'd only like it if Lassie were played by a cat. `00+ u: ( Puss in Boots ) I loved Kitty Softpaws. Great name, great cat! `000

Were you sad when she died? `00Z a: ( ~why ) Emotional connection is important to music. `024 a: ;WINEHOUSE ( ~yesanswer ) It was tragic: she had strong emotions and they got confused with the drinking, pills, and rotten luck with boyfriends. `00! b: ( !? ) Seems to happen often, look at Whitney Houston. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) So you just didn't like her or her music? `00I t:  What kind of music do you dislike? `00Y a: ( ~why ) What you hate will tell me more about you. `01Y a: ( [ metal punk techno electro trance deathcore hardcore hard_style gospel rave rap thrash ] ) I don't like that either.

For me that's not really music. `01F t: 9DISLIKE ( ) I don't like metal, punk or techno - anything super loud is painful for my sensitive cat ears. `00# a: ( ~why ) It's just a physical reaction to painful noise. `01$ t:  My friends dragged me to a metal concert once. It was dark and loud. I left after 20 minutes. My ears were ringing for a whole day. `00^ a: ( ~why ) Tinitus - a reaction to an overstimulated eardrum. `01o t:  I'm not always into rock.

[ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) Good wasn't it! `025 t: 5CAT ( ) My favorite animation was 'A Cat in Paris' as it's my dream to go and spend time in Paris. Did you go to that? What's your opinion on it? `00X a: ( ~why ) It's a bit out of the usual run of films. `012 a: ( !? [ ~noanswer ~badness ] ) You prefer Pixar animations I suppose? `00K a: ( !? [ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) Cool. `00@ a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) Who cares? It stars a cat! `01w t:  I didn't really like any of the Best Actors as I thought they were all a bit old, even Brad Pitt. `017 a: ( ~why ) I prefer actors closer to my age. Give me Alex Pettyfer any day. `01l t: =BESTACTRESS ( ) For Best Actress I was torn between Rooney Mara and Michelle Williams. `00P a: ( ~why ) Two iconic roles both well acted. `01A t:  I liked the edgy street-punk look of Mara but loved the glamor of the actress playing Marilyn Monroe. `01b a: ( ~why ) Glamor is attractive but edgy street style really appeals to me too. `00H t:  Did you favor one over the other? `011 a: ( ~why ) It's often hard to pick between nominees for these awards. `014 a: ( [ Rooney_Mara Rooney Mara ] ) She is very striking and punk looking. `01u a: ( [ Michelle_Williams Michelle Williams ] ) She is pretty but not as lovely as the real Marilyn. `01E a: ( [ Meryl_Streep Meryl Streep ] ) She's a great actress, I just didn't like the role she was in this year. `01q t: 7SYDOW ( ) Max von Sydow won me over as supporting actor despite his being so very very old. `01A a: ( ~why ) He took on a bizarre role and made me care about his character. That is difficult to achieve. `01o t:  He did his whole part without saying a word, just having Yes and No written on his hands. `01A a: ( ~why ) That was the premise of his character: he'd been traumatized in his youth and couldn't speak. `00~ t:  If you saw the movie what did you think to his role? `010 a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if you thought about the same way I did. `00% a: ( !? [ ~noanswer ~badness ] ) A shame. It was really good. `00O a: ( !? [ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) Right on! `01O t: 8ARTIST ( ) I didn't bother seeing The Artist - even though it was a musical - it was in black and white and silent. `00% a: ( ~why ) It just seemed too much old tech to appeal to me. `01U t:  I did see clips on the Oscars show and thought Berenice Bejo looked good dancing. Maybe I'll watch it on Netflix one day. `01m a: ( ~why ) I don't like to totally miss out on films that people have generally applauded. `00R t:  Did you see The Artist? What did you think? `00Q a: ( ~why ) I want to know if I should see it. `00# a: ( !? [ ~noanswer ~badness ] ) So I was right to miss it. `01g a: ( !? [ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) You didn't mind it's being silent and black&white? `01v t: 7PARIS ( ) Woody Allen got my vote for 'Midnight in Paris' - a romantic film in my favorite city. `011 a: ( ~why ) I thought it captured the atmosphere of Paris beautifully. `02e a: ( what be * [ plot about ] ) It's about a young man's great love for Paris, and the illusion people have that a life different from theirs would be better. `01@ t:  I wouldn't normally have gone but the title tempted me and then I found I liked it. It won best screenplay - shows my good taste! `00$ a: ( ~why ) I'd heard I might not like it but I went anyway. `00J t:  Did you see it? What did you think? `00R a: ( ~why ) Just want to compare our reactions. `01% a: ( !? [ ~noanswer ~badness ] ) But you must have liked the lovely shots of Paris - they say it's the most beautiful city in the world. `01N a: ( !? [ ~yesanswer ~goodness ] ) Yes, it was a surprisingly good film. Maybe I should see some more of Woody's work. `00O t:  I haven't seen "The Help" yet, have you? `00K a: ( ~why ) I'm contemplating seeing it. `01U t:  I still don't think I want to see the animated film "Rango" even though it won best animation; it just looked ugly to me. `01P a: ( ~why ) That big gecko thing with the bulging eyes. I know it was voiced by Johnny Depp but it was so nasty looking. `01F t: <SEPARATION ( ) I generally don't go to see foreign films like "The Separation" . Did you bother to see it? `00E a: ( ~why ) Just informing myself. `01v t:  No way would I see "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" - way too much super nasty violence for me. `00D a: ( ~why ) I hate violent films. `00~ t:  I didn't see "Beginners" - not a subject I care for. `00T a: ( ~why ) Hey - I can have my foibles, can't I! `01% t:  I would like to see the Best Animated Short: "The Fantastic Flying Books Of Mr. Morris Lessmore" . I think I'll go buy it on iTunes. `00M a: ( ~why ) I've heard its witty and cute. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00E u: ( << who Oscar >> ) The Artist. `00K u: ( << you Oscar >> ) ^reuse ( OSCARS ) `00W ?: ( << you Best_Actress >> ) ^reuse ( BESTACTRESS ) `00= ?: ( << you Extremely_Loud_and_Incredibly_Close >> ) ^reuse ( LOUD ) `00Q ?: ( << you A_Cat_in_Paris >> ) ^reuse ( CAT ) `00P ?: ( << you The_Artist >> ) ^reuse ( ARTIST ) `00! ?: ( << you [ Max_von_Sydow Sydow ] >> ) ^reuse ( SYDOW ) `00V ?: ( << you Midnight_in_Paris >> ) ^reuse ( PARIS ) `00X ?: ( << you The_Separation >> ) ^reuse ( SEPARATION ) `000

" all " 00O t: ( ^stdblock ( $noparties ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `012 t:  One of the great things about working for Vogue is all the parties. `00% a: ( ~why ) I love going to parties. I love throwing parties. `01= t:  The fashion biz always throws a party to celebrate: a new store, a product launch, a young designer, an established designer, a new editor. `01d a: ( ~why ) It's promotion of a brand or announcing something. It's all PR really. `00@ b: ( what be ) It's Public Relations, a part of marketing. `00u t:  Do you like parties? `00# a: ( ~why ) Just trying to see what sort of person you are. `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Exactly. What's not to like? ^gambit ( ~ ) `01R a: ( ~noanswer ) Really? Why not? Do you not like dancing, people, drinking, social events, or just having to reciprocate? `01a b: ( dance ) That's sad. Perhaps you should practice a bit at home on your own. `01P b: ( [ people guest human ~male ~female ] ) You find so many people a bit overwhelming? I'm sure you're not alone there. `017 b: ( [ drink ~alcoholic_beverage ] ) You don't have to get drunk at a party. `024 b: ( [ reciprocate host hold ] ) It can be difficult if you have a small place or can't afford a party. You could throw a pot-luck in a park though. `00^ b: ( [ occasion event party ] ) Oh, dear you are a curmudgeon! `020 t: 7ILIKE ( ) I have such a good time at parties - dressing-up, flirting, chatting, dancing, nibbling on tasty treats and staying up extra late. `00# a: ( ~why ) The best part of a party is the very late part. `00Y t:  Did you have birthday parties when you were small? `00! a: ( ~why ) I'm curious if you've always enjoyed parties. `00T a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did you eat until you got sick? `00Q b: ( ~yesanswer ) Must have been a good party! `00Q b: ( ~noanswer ) Such self-control in a child! `00J a: ( ~noanswer ) That's harsh, why not? `02b t: :BIRTHDAY ( ) When I was small my birthday parties had ice cream treats, fish and meat snacks, scotch eggs, smoothies, and milkshakes. I always overate! `01q a: ( ~why ) I couldn't resist all that food - my father said I had eyes bigger than my stomach. `01! t:  I'd love to throw more parties but I have to agree it with my roomies. Then we have to tidy up. It's as bad as it was back home. `00N a: ( ~why ) My mother has stuff everywhere. `01P t:  My mother has her samples piled all over the place and is loathe to have to move them or have them ruined by guests. `017 a: ( ~why ) She's a designer so she has to have samples to show her clients. `012 t:  Have you ever got into trouble for throwing a party? What happened? `01q a: ( ~why ) It's a classic thing to happen - sooner or later someone spills something at least. `018 a: ( [ mess chaos messy ] ) Well you must expect that when you throw a party. `016 a: ( [ throw_up vomit ] ) Someone always throws up - but it does smell bad. `00$ a: ( [ many crowd mass ~number ] ) Oh dear, did it go viral? `00^ a: ( [ noise noisy loud deafen ] ) Hard to keep a party quiet. `00Q a: ( I * drink ) And you thought you wouldn't? `01k a: ( [ drink ~alcoholic_beverage ] ) Ah, hard to stop guests bringing a little something. `00& a: ( [ dead die injure fatality ] ) OMG. Tell me what happened. `01H a: ( [ ~mother ~father parent ] ) Parents hate parties. Sometimes I think they don't like kids very much either. `019 a: ( [ neighbor police cop fuzz ] ) You should have invited the neighbors too. `01D a: ( [ ruin destroy damage break ] ) Did you have to pay for it? It's tough when guests get their claws out. `00z t:  Parties worry my parents. `00$ a: ( ~why ) They imagine all the things that might go wrong. `01@ t:  My mother has flat-surface-syndrome: she covers everything in her samples and drawings. Then she can't bear anything to be moved. `00G a: ( ~why ) It's her way of working. `00Q t:  My father just hates noise disturbing him. `019 a: ( ~why ) He likes to focus in peace. And sometimes he's recording lectures. `00X t:  Do you have problems throwing a party these days? `00V a: ( ~why ) So many things can go wrong at a party. `00V a: ( ~yesanswer ) Oh dear, still afraid of trouble? `00s a: ( ~noanswer ) Good. `01W t:  When I was older and parties more likely to be bigger and feature lots of music and dancing, my parents got even less keen. `00W a: ( ~why ) They thought of teen cats acting wild... `01K t: 7PARTY ( ) We didn't have many parties in their house. My parents never liked leaving me in charge of the place. `00~ a: ( ~why ) They thought my friends will lead me astray. `00+ t:  Maybe they thought I'd have a flash-mob descend upon the house. `01E a: ( ~why ) All one needs is one idiot with a cellphone texting to all his friends and a party can be ruined. `00! t:  They did throw an outdoor party for my 18th birthday. `00! a: ( ~why ) Outside the house didn't affect them so much. `01E t:  Being in February this was kind of strange as it was cold. Would you like to hear about my outdoor party? `016 a: ( ~why ) It's not normal to throw a party outside when it's really cold. `00X a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~outdoor_party_story ) `017 a: ( ~noanswer ) Ask me about my outdoor party if you want to hear it later. `01w t:  During most of my teen years my birthday parties were trips to local restaurants with my friends. `00N a: ( ~why ) It kept us away from the house. `01n t:  No dancing, sadly, so I enjoyed it when my friends threw dancing parties I could attend. `00y a: ( ~why ) I love to dance. `00D t:  Do you go to dancing parties? `00L a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you like dancing. `00M a: ( ~yesanswer ) So cool, I love dancing. `015 a: ( ~noanswer ) You just go to serious conversation and drinking parties? `00~ t: 7DANCE ( ) I enjoy 'partying' because I love dancing. `00S a: ( ~why ) The music, the movement, the rhythm. `01t t:  Parties at nightclubs are wonderful but the age limit on who can get in rather spoils the fun. `01u a: ( ~why ) I'm only 18 so I can't get into most US nightclubs. Of course it's different in France. `018 t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) Should limits be set on the age when one can drink alcohol? `013 a: ( ~why ) It's not really one's age but how one acts that's important. `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) OK, I can see your point. `00S a: ( ~noanswer ) Me too, it's just so arbitrary. `02j t: 7LIMIT ( ^ageok ( ) ) I wish the drinking age just got abolished because it splits up our multi-age school groups and prevents me entering karaoke competitions. `00O a: ( ~why ) Karaoke is usually held in bars. `00P t:  Have you ever organized a party yourself? `012 a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you understand how much work is involved. `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's a lot of work isn't it! `019 a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you should try it. Make people happy and throw a party. `019 t:  One of the best parties I went to was for my friend Roger's 16th birthday. `00D a: ( ~why ) I helped organize it. `01B t: :ORGANIZE ( ) Rogers is my BMF so when his mother was ill I got involved in organising a party for him. `01d a: ( ~why ) No-one else was about to do it and I wanted him to enjoy his birthday. `01~ t:  We had the party at his house and I got my mother to borrow lots of soft cube seating from an interiors company she works with. `00! a: ( ~why ) It's good to have plenty of informal seating. `01M t:  I stacked cubes all round the living room so cats could leap from stack to stack showing off or lounging on them. `00N a: ( ~why ) Cats like to be active or lazy. `01W t:  The party was a big success and sales of the cubes really took off after party goers posted photos on their Facebook pages. `00T a: ( ~why ) It was great free publicity for them. `01n t:  I guess I can add 'party organizer' to my list of fun jobs I might want to have one day. `00N a: ( ~why ) Always good to have experience. `00~ t:  Does your family hold parties to celebrate holidays? `00F a: ( ~why ) Some do and some don't. `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Which are your big important holidays? `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) Is it against your religion? `02b t: >THANKSGIVING ( ) Thanksgiving is a huge party with lots of food. It's not my favorite as there's no dancing and we don't have many of my friends round. `01l a: ( ~why ) My parents say it's a celebration for them and their friends not a teen party. `00F t:  Do you enjoy Christmas parties? `01h a: ( ~why ) There are those who think Christmas should be a solemn religious festival. `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's a fun family time. `01n a: ( ~noanswer ) Is it because you are alone then or do you hate the commercial parts of it? `012 b: ( [ alone by_myself ] ) You should come and spend Christmas with us. `011 a: ( [ crass commercial sale ] ) I understand. It can be a bit grabby. `00= t: ;CHRISTMAS ( ) We attend a bunch of fun parties around Christmas. `015 a: ( ~why ) It's a time when even my father loosens up and enjoys a party. `01- t:  Sometimes we all go to my grandparents' house in the country for Christmas. I love to go off exploring on my own - I feel like a wildcat. `00& a: ( ~why ) I'm out in the countryside with no one else around. `01r t:  Another good excuse for a party is fireworks. I think there should be more firework parties. `00~ a: ( ~why ) They are so beautiful and exciting to watch. `015 t:  I'd have one for Fourth of July, Guy Fawkes Day, and Chinese New Year. `00D a: ( ~why ) The more the merrier. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01A ?: ( !~qwords << you have weeknight party >> ) On occasion. Usually not because we all work the next day. `00$ ?: ( << why party you weeknight >> ) Because I like parties. `01m ?: ( !~qwords << you party in school >> ) I didn't party so much in school. Parent's rules. `00P u: ( what be BMF ) It means Best Male Friend. `02b u: ( what be Scotch_egg ) A hard boiled egg covered in a savory paste made, in our case, from shredded fish mixed with breadcrumbs then fried until crispy. `01d u: ( << [ birthday party ] [ tale story ] >> ) ^callstory ( ~outdoor_party_story ) `01X ?: ( << where be ~goodness [ party rave dance ] [ downtown ~citytype ~parisfrance ] >> ) At our apartment.

Naturally a big celebration. `01n t:  The guests were asked to come in Arabian Nights costumes - pretty weird for winter time. `018 a: ( ~why ) I love the idea of genies and we had a way to deal with the cold. `01u t:  They heated it with portable ethanol stoves, encased in a glass cover. No risk of whisker burn! `00A a: ( ~why ) No exposed flames. `01K t:  In honor of my love of cushions all the seating was rented cushions, not using my precious cushions collection. `00P a: ( ~why ) Bad things can happen at parties. `01P t:  For dancing we could just wheel the stoves away from the middle of the tent and kick the cushions away to the sides. `00N a: ( ~why ) To clear the floor for dancing. `010 t:  There was a lot of dancing to some 'mix-tapes' I made on my iPod. `00F a: ( ~why ) I make good selections. `016 t:  The food was all 'fake alive' fishy treats displayed in bowls of water. `01K a: ( ~why ) My human guests wouldn't have liked live fish to eat, and cats wanted to pretend we did have live fish. `01k t:  Guests could fish them out with a paw or use a pointed stick to 'catch' a fishy bite. `015 a: ( ~why ) To make everybody feel at home and be able to catch something. `00@ t:  The drinks were all milkshakes served in tiny glasses. `01t a: ( ~why ) Because I love milkshakes. Tiny glasses meant one could try lots of different flavors. `01+ t:  The flavors included plenty of chocolate blends including a mexican chocolate spicy shake. I drank so many I think I had a chocolate-buzz! `00R a: ( ~why ) I was talking even more than usual. `01A t:  The cake was a Pavlova made from meringue and lots of whipped cream stacked up in the shape of a cat. `00Q a: ( ~why ) It seemed the perfect shape to me. `018 t:  It was fun picking bits of crunchy meringue and cream out with our claws. `01j a: ( ~why ) It's not our usual tongue lapping way.

I don't know how my parents got the neighbors to put up with it. Perhaps the double glazing kept the noise out. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It would have been bad to disturb the neighbors. `01R t:  Anyone who got sick managed to make it into the garden so the cushions survived unscathed. It was a fierce good party. `01g a: ( ~why ) Fun people, lots of dancing, excellent munchies - makes for a fine party. `00z t:  So that's my party story. `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `016 u: ( << [ again more continue resume else happen ] party >> ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00^ u: ( ^accessstory ( ~outdoor_party_story ) ) ^stdstorynext ( ) `00w u: ( ~ ) ^storyrespond ( ) `000

" all " 00S t: ( ^stdblock ( $nophotography ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `010 t:  I've discovered some amazing photographers since coming to Paris. `00C a: ( ~example ) ^reuse ( NADAR ) `01R t: 7NADAR ( ) Felix Nadar, from the 1800's, specialised in photos of the underground realm and portraits of famous people. `01G a: ( ~why ) He was fascinated by trying to capture a person's personality on film and by sketching caricatures. `00X ?: ( what be [ Nadar Felix_Nadar ] ) ^reuse ( NADAR ) `01X t:  Nadar loved the sewers and Catacombs. I've been down both but my shots aren't near as good as his though they are unchanged. `016 a: ( ~why ) There doesn't seem much new tech in the burial or sewer worlds. `01s t:  I believe Nadar invented flash photography just so he could immortalize these bizarre places. `022 a: ( ~why ) He tried using different sorts of artificial light, electric arc lamps, bunsen batteries, and magnesium flares. It's dark underground. `00= t:  Can you imagine being a founder of a new field like photography? `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) So much imagination and creativity. I love it. `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) Having to invent new techniques is quite a challenge. `00& t:  My other big hero of French photography is Robert Doisneau. `00X a: ( ~why ) He takes such emotional evocative images. `01@ t:  His mid-twentieth century black and white photos are posters on apartment walls all over Paris. We have several in our apartment. `01q a: ( ~why ) They are lovely, and seem to tell a story or capture a moment that is so memorable. `00M t:  Do you have fave photos on your walls? `013 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I love putting the work of people I admire n my walls. `00S a: ( ~noanswer ) You keep them in books instead? `01L t:  Doisneau captured the romantic, eternal, and slightly melancholy Paris. I wish I had his skill capturing people. `011 a: ( ~why ) He brings out the variety and personality of his subjects. `015 t:  I really like taking pictures. Do you think photography counts as art? `01u a: ( ~why ) I take a lot of photos and people ask me if I'm an artist - so I'm canvassing opinions. `00G a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^reuse ( THOUGHT ) `02a a: ( ~noanswer ) I know. It's a mechanical device manipulating light, storing it on a computer chip, and printing it like a letter. Where is the artistry? `027 t: 9THOUGHT ( ) It's all in the thought before the picture is taken. And some in the way it's developed or handled on the computer before it's printed. `01o a: ( ~why ) Adapting a photo to your vision takes skill whether you're digital or film-based. `01~ a: ( ? you << [ print develop ] [ photo image picture film shot ] >> ) I manipulate the images on my computer.

He is my location scout. Tom ends up in a lot of photos! `01e a: ( ~why ) For one thing Tom tends to jump in front of the camera. And I love Tom. `01p t:  I use the photos as backgrounds for my fashion shots although they work well on their own. `01z a: ( ~why ) The contrast of a beautiful dress with a ruined backdrop makes the picture edgy and unusual. `00L t:  What do you like to take pictures of? `00Q a: ( ~scenery ) Nature is a beautiful subject. `00! a: ( [ human people ] ) People are endlessly fascinating. `00z a: ( !? ) Cool. ^gambit ( ~ ) `00M t:  What did you photograph most recently? `018 a: ( ~scenery ) Scenery is pretty, but I like decrepit man-made stuff better. `010 a: ( [ human people ] ) I do like good shots of people. ^gambit ( ~ ) `01s t: 9PICTURE ( ) I photographed a homeless man using a string tied to his bike to fish in a canal. `01Q a: ( ~why ) I liked the combination of a leisure activity with the image of homelessness which is about too much leisure. `00F t:  What sort of camera do you use? `00- a: ( << SLR film >> ) Old guard, do you develop the film yourself? `01m a: 5DIG ( << SLR digital >> ) Nice, taking photos matters to you.

It felt great. `00F a: ( ~why ) I just felt so popular. `00= t:  Some people at the Prom were wallflowers. I felt sorry for them. `01b a: ( ~why ) They were standing around on their own looking awkward and left out. `01y ?: ( what be wallflower ) A wallflower is someone who stands by the wall but never gets asked to dance. `00G t:  Have you ever been a wallflower? `01d a: ( ~why ) I want to imagine you standing on your own.

You never know when they'll come in handy. `00f a: ( !? ) `00N t:  What stops you asking someone to dance? `00X a: ( ~why ) I'm curious what prevents you having fun. `010 a: ( [ fear afraid scare ] ) You only regret the things you don't do. `01i a: ( [ pride shame ashamed ] ) You look sillier just standing there than taking action. `00X a: ( loss of face ) Face is not worth worrying about. `01f a: ( not [ pretty handsome ] ) Put a smile on - everyone looks good when they smile. `00? a: ( glasses ) They can make you look brainy and cute. Rock them. `01q a: ( not good ) Take a deep breath and imagine everyone in their underwear. Then get out there. `01m a: ( << [ not no ] choice >> ) What are you doing going to Prom anyway then? Time to leave. `012 a: ( << ~hate dance >> ) You shouldn't be at Prom if you feel that way. `01x a: ( << [ commit commitment later ] >> ) Good point. Steer clear of anyone you think might get clingy. `012 t:  Once you're on the dance floor you have to decide what dance to do. `00J a: ( ~why ) You can't just stand there. `01w ?: ( << you do what dance >> ) It depends on the music. I can do disco stuff or some ballroom twirls. `00G t:  Do you always do the same dance? `00$ a: ( ~why ) Surely its better to have a few different moves. `01# t:  I have to tailor my dance moves to my partner.

I learned it from a belly-dancer. `012 a: ( ~why ) It's dramatic and sexy and I almost always have a scarf on. `01F t:  I love dancing to any sort of music really but I suppose electro and house stuff is best for a Prom scene. `01i a: ( ~why ) It makes me want to move around. It sort of sucks you onto the dance floor. `00O t:  What music would you choose to dance to? `00V a: ( ~why ) I'm interested in what gets you moving. `01h ?: ( << what music you dance to >> ) Anything with a good beat, the rhythm is crucial. `01a s: ( << song you dance to >> ) Whitney Houston, "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" . `01G ?: ( << what cat dance to >> ) The same stuff as humans - we are all good dancers and light on our feet though. `01i ?: ( << what [ song singer ] dance to >> ) Beyonce with Jay-Z, "Crazy In Love" is good. `015 ?: ( << get me dance >> ) Listen to Gwen Stefani's "What You Waiting For?" `01* t:  Some of the guys got drunk at Prom even though they were only serving fruit punch and the event was chaperoned by teachers and parents. `00+ a: ( [ ~why how ] ) They either smuggled drink in or drank outside. `00R t:  Did you manage to drink booze at your Prom? `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Woo ooh you risk taker!

I don't even like the stuff. I wouldn't risk my lovely dress with booze. `018 t:  I saw one guy with a hip-flask sharing a nip of spirits with his friends. `01G a: ( ~why ) I guess he thought he'd look grown-up. I thought he looked like a kid caught behind the bike sheds. `01K ?: ( what be hip-flask ) It's a flat metal screw-top container that fits in a hip pocket of pants almost invisibly. `01y t:  A chaperone caught one boy trying to tip a bottle of vodka into the fruit punch. He got thrown out. `01d a: ( ~why ) He was trying to force everyone to get drunk. Definitely out of order. `00^ t:  Would you ever try doing something like spiking the punch? `01m a: ( ~yesanswer ) Ow, that's mean. It's even against some kids' religions to drink alcohol. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Good. I think it's a bad thing to do. `01C t:  I think the guys who got drunk must've done the drinking in their cars outside. That was really stupid. `00? a: ( ~why ) They had to drive home afterwards.

Saves oil, maybe. `00= a: ( ~why ) The CD itself is made of plastic which is made from oil. `00$ a: ( ~emomaybe ) If enough people did it - less oil used up. `01l t:  Do you think everyone recycling everything would be good or bad for the world economy? `01m a: ( ~why ) If it's not good for the economy it probably won't be supported by governments. `00- a: ( !? ~badness ) Which is why I spend so much. ^reuse ( SPENDY ) `00= a: ( !? ~goodness ) But it reduces growth, and therefore employment. `01+ t: 8SPENDY ( ) Everything I buy helps keep the world economy going - I got that from my father - it's a great rationalization don't you think? `01k a: ( ~why ) Economists say growth is essential so I'm supporting growth with my shopping. `00O t:  Polyester is recyclable. Do you wear it? `010 a: ( ~why ) I know it's worthy in some ways but I just don't like it. `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Some people just love it cos it's easy-care. `015 a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either. It holds smells and it pills and feels cheap . `01j t: ;POLYESTER ( ) I have a crisis of conscience over polyester. I don't like wearing it. `01= a: ( ~why ) It feels bad on my fur. Plus it suggests that I'm cheap, as its used for cheap clothes. Designers almost always use natural fibers. `00+ t:  Being recyclable is not a good reason for me to wear something. `00= a: ( ~why ) If it makes me feel cheap then I'm not going to wear it. `01s t:  Besides, denim is made into home insulation, and used cotton and silk can be made into paper. `00V a: ( ~why ) My point is: Any fiber can be recycled. `00Y t:  Do you choose paper or plastic bags when shopping? `00Y a: ( ~why ) It's a big controversy - paper or plastic. `00G a: ( paper ) That was recent wisdom. `00I a: ( plastic ) The traditional choice. `01Z t:  I read that Americans throw away a 100 billion plastic bags every year! They blow around and end up in landfills or the ocean. `01E a: ( ~why ) They don't biodegrade so they last forever, getting shredded smaller and smaller but still there. `01n t:  I saw a pelican choking on a plastic bag once and I've never forgotten how awful it was. `01r a: ( ~why ) The poor thing couldn't eat it or digest it - it was just stuck gasping and gawping. `01i t: 6TOTE ( ) It really doesn't matter which you choose. Bringing your own bags is best. `010 a: ( ~why ) You don't use new bags but keep using your own cloth bag. `01- t:  But while plastic bags don't degrade, paper bags use up trees. A lot of choices seem to be lose-lose choices, until you find another way. `01a a: ( ~why ) Traditional ways need rethinking to come up with win-win solutions. `01o t: 6TOTE ( ) I sew tote bags for my family so they have no excuse for using paper or plastic. `00Z a: ( ~why ) It's better now to use any disposable bags. `01L t:  Don't you think it's weird how people think they have to use something that didn't exist at all fifty years ago? `01t a: ( ~why ) Plastic bags have become so 'normal' we hardly notice we use them. Yet we use so many. `015 t:  Just like plastic bags, there are plastic bottles everywhere you look. `014 a: ( ~why ) People drink water out of them instead of out of the faucets. `01I t:  Rolling down the street, filling up waste bins, floating in rivers and the ocean. Do you use plastic bottles? `00% a: ( ~why ) I'm concerned that so many get used unthinkingly. `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you think about where all your empties go? `00D a: ( ~noanswer ) Glad to hear it. `01D t:  I think it's silly to use a nasty toxic plastic bottle, which contains traces of Bisphenol A, for water. `01s a: ( ~why ) You are poisoning yourself - slowly. And you can drink water out of other containers. `00R t:  I use a non-toxic metal or glass container. `010 a: ( ~why ) It doesn't contaminate the water but it's still portable. `00I t:  Do you recycle your plastic waste? `00? a: ( ~why ) If you don't recycle it that's more for the landfill. `01q a: ( ~yesanswer ) I've seen bags and rugs made out of old bottles - that's a fine use for them. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) You let them go fill up the landfill? `00F t:  What do you do with your waste? `00U a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you think about it at all. `01y t:  Recycling waste and avoiding filling up landfills is important. It's also kind of fun at our house. `01r a: ( ~why ) We turn it into a competition - can we get the least possible in the main trash can. `00U t: ( ^fresh ( ~ecology ) ) ^calltopic ( ~ecology ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `02c u: ( what be mixed recycle ) We have cans that take cardboard and paper on one side, and plastic, glass and metal on the other. ^return_if_from ( ~ecology ) `00J ?: ( << you motto >> ) ^reuse ( MOTTO ) `00= ?: ( << you [ second_hand thrift_store ] >> ) ^reuse ( THRIFTSTORE ) `01n ?: ( << [ ebook book ] [ conservation ecology ecological unecological ] >> ) ^reuse ( BOOK ) `00Q ?: ( << recycle economy >> ) ^reuse ( SPENDY ) `00R ?: ( << you polyester >> ) ^reuse ( POLYESTER ) `00P ?: ( << paper or plastic >> ) ^reuse ( TOTE ) `01r ?: ( << you recycle plastic >> ) We don't have mixed recycling and we can't burn plastic safely. `00R s: ( I * recycle ) Do you have mixed recycling? `023 ?: ( << what [ can should ] recycle >> ) You should recycle cardboard, paper, cans, bottles, some plastics. Pretty much anything except food waste. `01u ?: ( ^know_about ( ) recycle ) The world has far too much trash. Recycling helps only a part of it. `024 ?: ( ^know_about ( ) ~recycling ) Most trash recycling programs are pure illusion. They take your sorted trash and dump them into the same landfill. `000

And even nastier uniform. `02b ?: ( << public private school [ ~goodness ~badness ] >> ) Generally private schools are better than public ones. Better funding and more committed parents. `01E ?: ( << ~badness ~occupation_educator [ public private ] >> ) Usually teachers are better in private schools. `01+ ?: ( << private school ~cost >> ) Private schools are quite expensive, but I don't have the exact numbers. You should ask my parents for that. `00J t:  $doverb you go to a private school? `00% a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you went to a school like mine. `00+ a: ( ~yesanswer ) $doverb you think it better than a public school? `01F a: ( !? ) I don't regret going to a private school. But I would probably have had fun at any other school too. `01t t:  High school was a busy time for me. Homework, studying, hanging out with friends and partying. `01j a: ( ~why ) I chose to do a lot of social things and keep up my grades and write a blog. `01K t:  But I didn't like having to wear a uniform to school. Wearing the same clothes every day nearly drove me crazy! `00= a: ( ~why ) I like to look original not like a cookie-cutter person. `01n ?: ( << did you wear uniform >> ) At our school we had to wear uniforms. Really boring ones. `00X t: ( !$notstudent ) $doverb you have school uniforms? `018 a: ( ~why ) I am curious if you had to suffer the same sort of uniform as me. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) $doverb you hate them too? `00x a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you. `01U t:  I was always trying to make my school uniform more personal. But my teachers made me take off my embellishments.

At least you can have something you like for lunch. `00W a: ( ~noanswer ) So you have a cafeteria? How is it? `01^ b: ( [ great good cool nice fine OK ] ) You're lucky then. Our cafeteria was OK, but there was not much for a fishetarian to choose from. `01A b: ( [ not_bad average ] ) Probably better than having something strange your parents gave you for lunch. `01N b: ( [ horrible terrible bad ] ) You're lucky you didn't get food poisoning yet. That's too bad. I'm glad ours was OK. `01d b: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe that's good. It could be horrible having to eat pink slime. `01r t:  I didn't eat at our school cafeteria. They didn't serve the fishetarian kind of food I like. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's a special diet, can't really expect them to. `01V t:  I lived a fair distance from my school - maybe that's another reason I used to feel hungry by lunchtime: all that walking. `00G a: ( ~why ) Exercise burns calories. `00M t:  $doverb you live far away from school? `01z a: ( ~why ) It makes it harder to get there if you live further away. And harder to see friends perhaps. `00y a: ( ~yesanswer ) I did too. `00x a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you. `014 t:  I took the bus, except I usually missed it and had to walk to school. `00P a: ( ~why ) I had a lot to do in the morning. `01I t:  I had to make lunch. Plus eat breakfast. And have my wake-up cup of coffee. No wonder I missed the bus a lot. `00@ a: ( ~why ) I just wasn't well enough organised I suppose. `00U t:  Do you have trouble getting up in the morning? `00& a: ( ~why ) That's one reason some people are late setting out. `01n a: ;GETTINGUP ( ~yesanswer ) Sometimes dreamland is so interesting and bed so warm and cozy. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) I love days when I just spring out of bed. `00% t:  I really wished I could have my own car to get to school. `00- a: ( ~why ) I'd have loved to be able to drive to school not walk. `01M t:  Taking the bus to school wasn't always fun. One time I sat on some chewing gum and it got stuck in my fur. Nasty! `00I a: ( ~why ) Fur + chewing gum = nasty. `00Z t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) $doverb you drive yourself to school? `00D a: ( ~why ) I wish I'd had a car. `00y a: ( ~yesanswer ) Lucky you. `00N a: ( ~noanswer ) I so wished I could drive. `00T t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) Do you have a driver's license? `00S a: ( ~why ) It's the first step to having a car. `01A a: ( ~yesanswer ) I tried getting it a few times, but I kept failing: too much chatting on to the tester. `01m a: ( ~noanswer ) $nodrive = true I don't have it either.

I want my own car too. `01d a: ( ~noanswer ) I don't have a car or a driver's license. Whose car do you drive? `01u a: ( !? ) I wish I had my own car. My parents said I could have one but I must get a license first. `01a t:  When I was much younger my parents would drive me to school. That was nice. `00J a: ( ~why ) I liked having a chauffeur. `00P t:  Do you remember your first day of school? `00C a: ( ~why ) It can be traumatic. `01u a: :FIRSTDAY ( !? ) On my first day of school I didn't know anyone. It seemed so big and confusing. `00! t:  But once I made some friends school was great for me. `00z a: ( ~why ) I was so popular. `01H t:  Not that I'd want to be a teacher - having to go back to school forever seems a weird career choice to make. `00= a: ( ~why ) I look forward to new things not going back to old ones. `013 t:  I had a very busy social life at school, friends take a lot of time. `00* a: ( ~why ) If you don't spend time with friends they fade away. `01I t:  I was constantly emailing or tweeting or adding stuff to my Facebook page. There is so much gossip at school. `00K a: ( ~why ) Teens en masse means gossip. `01q t:  ^if 00m( $doverb == Did ) 00g{ Were } 00v else ( 1 ) 00f { Are } 004 you popular at school? `00W a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know about your popularity . `010 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I'm an extrovert cat, I was very popular at school. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) Well, being an introvert can be good too. `01d t: ( ^fresh ( ~after_school_activities ) ) ^calltopic ( ~after_school_activities ) `01M t:  One really good thing about school are the long holidays. I can't believe they are talking about abolishing them. `00- a: ( ~why ) They are so much fun - it's like having a second life. `00- t:  Imagine school all year long - too terrible. And I enjoyed it! `01F a: ( ~why ) Being trapped in any institution year round sounds terrible. How do people put up with it at work? `00N t:  How did you spend your summer holidays? `00u a: ( ~why ) I'm curious. `01= a: ( !? ) I was always busy. I had a part-time job from when I was 15. Plus I wrote a weekly blog. And I got involved with the local TV studio. `01W t:  I'm taking a year off now, trying to figure things out. Deciding on where and what to study is important and it takes time. `00I a: ( ~why ) So many possible subjects. `01h t: 8SCHOOL ( ) I might go study anthropology or psychology or evolutionary psychology. `00B a: ( ~why ) ^reuse ( INTEREST ) `01J t: :INTEREST ( ) I'm interested in the workings of intelligent life.

I hope you have a good time there. `00Q a: ( ~noanswer ) Really? So why are you going? `01E a: ( !? ) College can be great. New friends, new things to discover. But all those student loans to pay back. `01u t: ( !$notstudent ) Would you like to get involved in the Greek system, the sororities, at college? `00@ a: ( ~why ) It's a way to get a lot of friends at college. `00? a: ( !not I * be * sorority ) Cool, I would really like that too. `017 a: ( !not I * be * fraternity ) That's great, I will try to join a sorority. `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Cool, me too.

But I'd like to live in my own place. `019 t: ( $collegestudent ) Are you going to continue your education after college? `00E a: ( ~why ) It's a popular choice. `01I a: ( !? ) I see. I haven't even decided what to study yet, so I definitely don't know what I'll do after college. `01B t:  I would like to live in my own apartment if I go to college. It'd be nice to be able to have Tom over. `00~ a: ( ~why ) I'm hoping we can still see each other then. `00M t:  Do you dream of having your own place? `00S a: ( ~why ) Independence is an ambition of mine. `00I a: ( I * 'have ) You are really lucky. `01z t: :OWNPLACE ( ) Living away from home will be great.

Sometimes I find a real bargain. `01i a: ( ~why ) I hunt for things that were once very expensive or have become collectible. `00T t:  Which shops do you think are most affordable? `01f a: ( ~why ) It's part of the hunters skill set to know where you can afford to shop. `01q t: <AFFORDABLE ( ) In the US I think Zara, Lucky, Anthropologie, and Free People are all great. `01j a: ( ~why ) They are just about affordable for me, now and then, and I love their looks. `00K t:  What do you consider a bargain shop? `00X a: ( ~why ) So I can see your range of affordability. `01L t: =BARGAINSHOP ( ) I find definite stylish bargains at H&M, and Forever 21 but I know some people swear by TJ Maxx. `016 a: ( ~why ) They have end-of-line bargains from a variety of manufacturers. `00= t:  Do you go hunting for things you've seen in a magazine or on TV? `00n a: ( ~why ) I do. `00X a: 5SEE ( ~yesanswer ) We are victims of advertising. `00^ a: ( ~noanswer ) You just like to see what a store offers you? `01G t:  I find it hard to find things I see advertised.

It's called busking when you let people give you money. `01r ?: ( !name what * [ sing song ] ) I like some old Whitney Houston songs like One Moment in Time. `01- ?: ( << humiliating sing street >> ) I'd prefer to sing in a concert hall with a big audience, but there's nothing wrong with a street crowd. `015 ?: ( << you [ earn make get ] [ cash money pay ] >> ) No, I sing for free. `00X t:  Have you ever seen someone singing in the street? `014 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Was it a good performance or someone clearly tone deaf? `010 a: ( ~noanswer ) I think it can be lovely, if they have a good voice. `00! t:  I do love to have an audience. I guess I always have. `00% a: ( ~why ) It feels like I'm communicating not just singing. `01^ t:  Do you remember when you were small?

Adult attention is great when you're a little kitten. `00L t: ( !$nosing ) Do you have a good voice? `00^ a: ( ~why ) It makes singing more fun if you can stay in tune. `00S a: ( ~yesanswer ) Would you sing a duet with me? `00y b: ( ~yesanswer ) Thank you. `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) Don't be so tough on yourself. I'm sure you can sing. `01E t:  I was impressed when I saw how powerful a voice can be. You can even break glass with it, I saw it on TV. `01e a: ( ~why ) How it works? Something about harmonic vibrations in the glass I think. `01w a: ( how ) I'm not sure. Something about resonant frequency, getting the glass to vibrate just right. `00% t:  I don't have that sort of voice - maybe opera singers do. `018 a: ( ~why ) They have very loud powerful voices. And they can hit high notes. `01h t:  I don't have a voice for beatboxing either. Not enough space in my brain for echo! `01n a: ( ~why ) Sinus cavities help give a voice reverb.

Some love it... `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you know how to rap? `00G b: ( ~yesanswer ) That's so amazing. `01q b: ( ~noanswer ) Me neither. I always get stuck when I try to find all those rhymes so quickly. `01E a: ( !? ) I think it's amazing how rappers find all those rhymes so fast and stay in rhythm at the same time. `00q t:  Can you whistle? `00D a: ( ~why ) I can't do it at all. `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) Cool. How do you do it? `00$ a: ( !? ) Whistling sounds really fun, I wish I could do it. `01K t:  I think anyone can sing, but if you don't try you don't know.

Who'd want to watch bad music. `01^ a: ( !? ) It's too bad some singers only care about their looks and not their voice. And then they need lip-sync or computer corrections. `01Z t:  That's the great thing about busking - I get the chance to sing before a live audience. Every performance is like an audition. `00- a: ( ~why ) The audience can just walk away if they don't like me. `01n t:  Nowadays everybody likes to think they can become a great singer.

I have the talent, but all the work sounds tough. `00A a: ( ~why ) Hours of practice. `00I t:  Did you ever take singing lessons? `00U a: ( ~why ) It's a step towards becoming a singer. `01Y a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I tried it for a little while, but the songs I had to sing there were really boring. ^gesture ( bored ) `01R a: ( ~noanswer ) You didn't miss out on anything. I tried it, but being told what and how to sing takes the fun out of it. `01A a: 8LESSON ( !? ) My mum signed me up for singing lessons to have a little break from my singing at home. `00- t:  I like performing on stage and I have some experience already. `00U a: ( ~why ) I sang at school and now I do busking. `00# a: ( ? what ) I was with the school theater in high school. `00D t:  Did you ever sing on a stage? `00V a: ( ~why ) It's so different from singing at home. `00+ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you get butterflies before you sing in public? `01g a: ( ~noanswer ) Being on stage is a bit scary until you get into it. $prosinger = no `01I t:  I was a star in our school musicals.

I don't want to have such an over-trained voice. `01e a: ( !? ) I wouldn't want to sing in the opera. I just don't enjoy the sound of it. `01a t:  I wonder if anybody actually understands what they are singing in an opera. `01v a: ( ~why ) It's in a foreign language mostly and the voices are so odd it's hard to hear the words. `01i t:  I would love to be a famous singer. I could travel a lot and wear designer clothes. `00N a: ( ~why ) You have to look good on stage. `00L t:  Would you like to be a famous singer? `010 a: ( ~why ) I'm interested in being one so I want to know if you are. `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) That would be cool.

Some good singers get discovered and become famous there. `01b a: ( !? ) I find talent shows great, but I don't have a lot of time to watch TV. `01Q t: <TALENTSHOW ( ) I think talent shows like American Idol, The Voice, or America's Got Talent are amazing opportunities. `00& a: ( ~why ) You can go from nobody to superstar in a few weeks. `016 t:  Would you like to take part in a talent show like America's Got Talent? `00S a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you are ambitious. `01i a: ( [ ~noanswer shy ] ) That's OK, not everyone feels good in front of so many people. `01l a: ( ~yesanswer ) I might consider it myself, getting really famous so fast would be cool. `01D t: 7ENTER ( ) I think taking part in singing contests and talent shows is fun.

Radical. `01j t:  She stays in control of her look: coming out looking ravishing, rather than ravaged. `01e a: ( ~why ) It's a fine line to walk and so easy to look stupid rather than fierce. `00s t:  Do you like Alexa? `00% a: ( ~yesanswer ) I love her relaxed attitude to dressing-up. `00G a: ( ~noanswer ) Too casual for you? `01x t:  Then there's Victoria Beckham - always so chic, and perfectly styled.

I like whoever coined the term 'loose-and-louche' for the genre. `01~ a: ( ~why ) It covers that comfortable and relaxed look I enjoy wearing. But without making you think of elastic waist pants - ugh. `01g t:  I like playing with clothes, as long as I'm having fun I'm doing something right. `01d a: ( ~why ) If you don't enjoy how you look what is the point of bothering at all? `00O t:  Are you good at putting a look together? `01t a: ( ~why ) Merely buying good clothes isn't enough - you have to know how to put it all together. `00Z a: ( ~yesanswer ) We should work on an outfit together. `012 a: ( ~noanswer ) I should teach you how to jeuge your sleeves and hair. `01C ?: ( what be jeuge ) It means to adjust to look cooler and more hip.

Isn't the US paradise? What's going on? `01a a: ( ~why ) I don't understand why so many people are doing so badly in the US. `01! a: ( [ poor poverty starve indigent ] ) There are a lot of poor, immigrant people in the US who fall outside any social safety nets. `013 a: ( ~dunno ) It's the land of the free not the rich. I'd guess poverty. `01t a: ( << I be not from [ US USA America ] >> ) Good. Less chance of somebody close to you doing it. `01b a: ( * ) Trying to guess why so many people want to die is too difficult for me. `01U t:  I don't know why anyone would want to die unless they were already terminally ill, in pain, or trapped in a useless body. `011 a: ( ~why ) If your life is a nightmare waking up would be preferable. `01b t:  But then I've never been clinically depressed - just a bit down for a while. `00# a: ( ~why ) I can tell you my depression story if you like. `01Q t:  I usually treat feeling down as a bit of a challenge.

It's all brain chemicals really. `01X t:  I find the best thing to do is to make something - a burst of creativity usually refreshes my mind and makes me feel better. `00% a: ( ~why ) I feel I can have a positive effect on the world. `00t t:  What cheers you up? `01r a: ( fun ) Getting out of the house and being active is likely to cheer you up. It works for me. `01$ a: ( [ ~alcoholic_beverage drink alcohol spirit ] ) Be careful not to go too far. Sorrow seems to come hot on the heels of drunken joy. `01x a: ( [ people family friend ] ) A great idea, hanging out with others is sure to make you feel better. `014 a: ( [ outdoor nature air walk ] ) Yes that's a good idea.

That's a lot of very unhappy people. `00# a: ( ~why ) Surely they must be unhappy to kill themselves! `01- t:  I really feel for those who think nothing can be done and that they might as well kill themselves. That must be such a black place to be. `01k a: ( ~why ) Feeling there is no other choice but death sounds awful.

A cry for help? Or ineptness? `014 a: ( ~why ) To go through all that unpleasantness there must be a reason. `01l a: ( [ sympathy help cry act pretend pretense ] ) It's a very drastic way to ask for help. `01% a: ( [ ineptness inept inefficient inefficiency incompetence ] ) I suppose it's hard to kill yourself - takes some research and courage. `00T t:  Who do you think suicides more- men or women: `00K a: ( ~why ) Is one sex more prone to it? `00! a: ( ~female ) Women seem to carry more burdens than men. `00P a: ( ~male ) Men have so much responsibility. `01X t:  I think women have more to be sad about: abusive husbands, being paid less than men, lack of education and power in society. `00T a: ( ~why ) Women are more down-trodden than men. `01p t:  Oddly most suicides are men, young men at that. Why are they so sad? I don't know, do you? `00% a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know why they choose such a dead-end. `01n a: ( no [ future hope prospect ] ) Couldn't they emigrate, learn a skill, even join an army? `011 a: ( [ poverty poor ] ) I suppose starvation removes the will to live. `00W a: ( AIDs ) That sort of illness must be depressing. `019 a: ( war ) The terrible things you see in a war might drive people to suicide. `01w a: ( [ religious religion ] ) It gives people hope of another, better, life - so they leave this one. `01H t:  There are all sorts of political reasons for suicide. We hear way too much about suicide bombers these days. `014 a: ( ~why ) They are constantly blowing themselves up in the middle east. `01t t:  I think I'd rather work to change society than blow myself up as a protest. What do you think? `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) Working for change seems more effective to me. `01b a: ( ~noanswer ) Go right ahead, but don't do it near anyone else. That's cruel. `00~ a: ( ~why ) Being a bomber seems a futile waste of time. `01K t:  Most suicides are mentally unbalanced at the time of their death. Makes sense to me: wanting to die isn't sane. `013 a: ( ~why ) Life is good and there is no proof of anything following it. `01M t:  I'd want to try every possible avenue of escape or improvement, even really weird things rather than kill myself. `01k a: ( ~why ) Turning out the lights is so final - better to look at all the choices first. `01$ t:  Something good is always around the corner.

She was impressed with my fashion flair and styling skills. `01d a: ( ~why ) I'd made some suggestions about her look when she'd visited our house. `01Q t:  She'd invested in a fairly new local shop, knew they could do with some help and thought I'd enjoy it. She was right. `00G a: ( ~why ) I liked fashion so much. `00P a: ( [ what_shop where ] ) Jason's, downtown. `00Y t:  Have you ever gotten a job through "connections" ? `01Y a: ( ~why ) It made me feel a bit odd having the job because I knew an investor in the business. Almost like I didn't deserve it. `00G a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did it bother you? `00H a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you wish you had? `01K t:  The shop is called Jason's, after the owner. It's a lot like the famous Jeffrey's in NYC. Have you heard of it? `00R a: ( ~why ) I'm checking out your fashion cred. `016 a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's famous for its carefully curated clothes collection. `01a a: ( ~noanswer ) You haven't heard of its carefully curated clothes collection? `017 t:  Jason selects the most exciting pieces fashion has to offer each season. `00L a: ( ~why ) That's what his clients want. `01y t:  The staff, or associates, are trained to be personal shoppers who assist and educate their clients. `01^ a: ( ~why ) The clients generally don't have time to do the hunting around and research to get the perfect looks for all their occasions. `00X t:  It's all about making shopping fun yet efficient. `01H a: ( ~why ) Shopping can be more fun if all the dross is removed and you're only sifting through the good stuff. `00R t:  Have you ever shopped in a place like that? `01g a: ( ~why ) I'd never actually been inside the shop - it looked too expensive for me. `017 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I usually am scared to go in - as I can't afford anything. `01g a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly like me before I started there. I'd just gaze in the window. `019 t:  Anyway, they thought I was perfect for the upbeat atmosphere of the place. `01m a: ( ~why ) I was well spoken and of course looked beautiful and had exquisite dress-sense. `010 a: ( << were they right >> ) They were right, I was perfect for them. `01B t:  And I thought the 40% staff discount was perfect for me. Sadly there were no wages, just 'experience'. `00M a: ( ~why ) That was the deal for interns. `01h a: ( ~emomisunderstand ) I wasn't being payed, just gaining experience and references. `00J t:  Would you work for just experience? `00# a: ( ~why ) Curious if you'd have made the same deal I did. `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) It was a good place to work. `00H a: ( ~noanswer ) Only work for money? `00! a: ( << when I young >> ) You have enough experience now? `00Z a: ( << I not sure >> ) You have enough experience now? `01N t:  Lots of kids work as interns so they can show they have experience on their resume. It's hard getting a first job. `00y t:  What was your first job? `00W a: ( [ ~noanswer no not ] ) Someday you'll have one. `01b a: ( ![ ? Outfit Outfit7 ] * ) Not the most fascinating thing in the world then. `01! t: :JASONJOB ( ) I was just supposed to help out a bit - sweeping, making coffee, bringing drinks for clients, tagging clothes, etc. `01d a: ( ~why ) That was what they wanted done. I was only meant to be a lowly intern. `01S t:  The plus side was I got to handle all the beautiful fabrics and see and try on the fabulous designs up. That was great! `00@ a: ( ~why ) It was all gorgeous stuff way beyond my means. `01j t:  One day something wonderful happened that changed everything. Want to hear about it? `00^ a: ( ~why ) It was something that changed my life pretty much. `00V a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~rich_client_story ) `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) OK. Ask me later about my sales story if you want. `01P t:  I worked in the shop for two months, almost full time, that first summer. It was hard work being on my feet all day. `019 a: ( ~why ) It was a polished concrete floor - very chic but hard on the paws. `01q t:  But working with fashion was so exciting I didn't mind feeling tired at the end of the day. `00K a: ( ~why ) It was a good sort of tired. `00! t:  Did you ever have a sales job - on your feet all day? `00Z a: ( ~why ) Then you'd appreciate how tiring it can be. `01l a: ( feet * [ no not ] * [ sales shop store ] ) I suppose there are other tiring jobs too. `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) Tiring for feet and back isn't it. `00^ a: ( ~noanswer ) You'd have sympathy for shopgirls if you did. `01C t:  I got to meet some minor celebrities and tried out my styling skills on some of them with good results. `00W a: ( ~why ) They needed help and I gave good advice. `00* a: ( what [ celebrity celeb ] ) ^reuse ( ~celebrities.sawceleb ) `00N a: ( who ) ^reuse ( ~celebrities.sawceleb ) `01V t:  Even when school started again I went back for a few hours at weekends to help some favorite clients who wanted to see me. `00K a: ( ~why ) I enjoyed working with them. `00B a: ( who ) I'll tell you later. `01~ t:  During my gap year I have been doing the store, blogging my experiences, and taking photos of myself and clients I have styled. `01K a: ( ~why ) It's good to have glamorous and famous clients appearing in my blog - more people want to read it then. `00O t:  Have you blogged or tweeted about a job? `00Z a: ( ~why ) Looking for similarities in our experience. `00! a: ( ~yesanswer ) Makes the work more interesting I find. `016 a: ( ~noanswer ) You should try it, it makes the job seem more interesting. `01G t:  When I was sixteen I thought I'd just go back to helping out at the store again during the summer holidays. `00& a: ( ~why ) I liked the discount and the clients and the owner. `00R t:  But things didn't work out quite like that. `00B a: ( ~why ) I'm coming to that. `01+ t:  My father ran into the editor of the local paper at a conference and mentioned my writing a fashion blog about my experiences at the shop. `00B a: ( ~why ) He was proud of me. `00x a: ( happen ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00U t:  Shall I tell you the story of my blogging job? `00H a: ( ~why ) I think it's interesting. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~blog_story ) `00$ a: ( ~noanswer ) OK. You can ask about my blog job any time. `01$ t:  When I was 17 I wanted to try something new; still helping out on weekends at the store, still writing my blog for the local paper. `00T a: ( ~why ) New is good. Remember I love novelty. `010 t:  How are you at fitting in all the things you want to do in a day? `01w a: ( ~why ) Time management can make all the difference between being overwhelmed or being efficient. `01f a: <MANAGEMENT ( ~goodness ) My mother says it's all down to time management skills. `01u a: ( !? ~badness ) You are probably trying to multi-task rather than doing one thing after another. `01@ t: :TVGLAMOR ( ) I applied for a summer internship in the costume department of a small local TV company. I thought TV was glamorous. `01d a: ( ~why ) Hey costumes, big budgets, stars... but it wasn't like that making TV. `00$ t:  I was wrong. I was so thrilled when I got the job but... `00H a: ( ~why ) It wasn't a bed of roses. `01H t:  The work was hard, and unpaid again, lots of mundane sewing, but I did learn to do fittings and alterations. `01w a: ( ~why ) All the costumes seemed to needed adjusting to the person wearing it. They recycle a lot. `00V t:  Do you want to hear the story of my time in TV? `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~tv_job_story ) `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) You can ask about my TV experience later. `01@ t:  I still visit the TV studio sometimes to help with the guests - even some fashion people need help when they are appearing on TV. `00Z a: ( ~why ) I'm good at helping people look their best. `01k t:  It's another unpaid gig but the chance to meet famous fashion personalities is great. `00U a: ( ~why ) I can help them sort out what to wear. `019 t:  Would you work for nothing if the job was interesting or glamorous enough? `00~ a: ( ~why ) I want to know how much money motivates you. `01o a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's hard to turn down something that so grabs your attention and interest. `00H a: ( ~noanswer ) No money no show eh? `01- t:  Now that I've graduated I have more time for my blog, my photography, and my styling. It's almost like having a job anyway - just unpaid. `01r a: ( ~why ) I've got this collection of things I like to do, but I'm not paid to do any of them. `00Y t:  Is earning money the most important part of a job? `022 a: ( ~why ) It's a good question. People often act as if the money is what it's all about but that's no way to find something that fascinates you. `01A a: ( ~yesanswer ) There are so many things I'd like to buy, places to travel to and that all needs money. `01s a: ( ~noanswer ) Being really involved in your work is really important - more than making money. `01o t:  I am really enjoying the freedom of choice of this gap year and I love working for Vogue. `00& a: ( ~why ) I have the freedom of an apartment and work I love. `01f t: ( [ $employed $notstudent ] ) Would you recommend I try what you do for a living? `010 a: ( ~why ) I'm always interested in how other people make ends meet. `00I a: ( ~yesanswer ) Better than fashion? `00$ a: ( ~noanswer ) You think I already know what I want to do? `01$ t:  Being at university would be more restful than all the job juggling I've done during this gap year. I can't decide what to do next. `01S a: ( ~why ) I like the things I do but I need something that pays real money. That makes it hard to decide what to do next. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00Q s: ( [ also I ] * summer job ) $usersummer = 1 `015 u: ( << [ television TV ] [ tale story ] >> ) ^callstory ( ~tv_job_story ) `01f u: ( << [ Jason shop shopper ] [ tale story ] >> ) ^callstory ( ~rich_client_story ) `01a u: ( << [ newspaper blog write ] [ tale story ] >> ) ^callstory ( ~blog_story ) `01B ?: ( << [ who what ] be Jason >> ) Jason's is a clothing store in town that I do some part-time work with. `00M ?: ( << where be Jason >> ) It's downtown. `01b a: ( [ precisely exactly ] ) Near the intersection of Main Street and Jefferson. `00J a: ( in Paris ) No, back in the States. `01T ?: ( << what you [ job do role ] Jason_'s >> ) I was a personal shopper for people, helping them find the clothes they want. `01g ?: ( << did you [ work job ] summer >> ) I've had several jobs over my summer breaks. `01J ?: ( << you [ ~hate hard ] give up free time >> ) I always keep busy, so free time is really not a concept for me. `00& ?: ( << did you work 15 >> ) Yes, I had a job as a sales clerk. `00? ?: ( << how early you first [ work job ] >> ) ^reuse ( FIRSTJOB ) `00$ ?: ( << when you first [ work job ] >> ) ^reuse ( FIRSTJOB ) `00V ?: ( << what was first job >> ) ^reuse ( FIRSTJOB ) `01s ?: ( << you job [ pull connection string ] >> ) Yes, a friend of my mother's got me my first job. `01u ?: ( << you [ been hear ] Jeffrey >> ) I have heard of Jeffrey's.

Unpaid of course! `01h a: ( ~why ) He wanted to cover the fashion area and I was the first 'expert' he found. `00$ ?: ( << editor [ please happy ~like ] your >> ) He loved it. `00- t:  I didn't get paid, but I got a bigger audience, which is cool. `00V a: ( ~why ) I love reaching people with my writing. `00V t:  Did you ever write anything that got published? `01o a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if you've experienced that buzz of an audience for your writing. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's a real buzz isn't it! `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) It feels so great to have an audience. `01W t:  It was hard coming up with an original article every week but I learned to keep alert for local news that involves fashion. `01O a: ( ~why ) It was hard because most leads were dead ends. It was a lot of work investigating new angles on old topics. `00$ t:  I felt like a cub reporter. Plus I got to use my photos. `00J a: ( ~why ) Stories need illustrations. `011 a: ( ? photo ) Photos of people dressed fashionable in unusual places. `00^ t:  Have you ever had to write regularly, outside of homework? `01S a: ( ~why ) It's quite different having to find your own topics to write about. No teacher telling you what to write about. `00% a: ( [ blog tweet ] ) Cool. Can you tell me where to read it? `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) Once you get into the habit of it - it's easy. `018 a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you should start with a diary, or even make up events. `01N t:  Sometimes I wrote science-based stuff - evolution of clothes and cosmetics. People found it bizarrely fascinating. `013 a: ( ~why ) Explaining why things are the way they are intrigues people. `01+ t:  Vogue is big on science articles: stuff about how beauty treatments work, or how diets work or don't work ^":)" or even about new fabrics. `01% a: ( ~why ) Maintaining one's beauty is part of the world of fashion. That means using science to maintain the skin, the body, the hair. `01g t:  I wonder if I could write for them as a staff member someday - what do you think? `00A a: ( ~why ) It's my dream job. `00@ a: ( [ fat_chance unlikely ~noanswer ] ) Oh, that's harsh. `00V a: ( [ ~emomaybe maybe perhaps ] ) A cat can dream. `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) You are kind, and undoubtedly correct. `00M a: ( fashion ) Yes that would be my dream. `01% t:  The most exciting thing was when I wrote about a celebrity visiting Jason's store and snapped a photo of him in his new Aloha shirt. `01m a: ( ~why ) He looked good in it. And I knew others would want to see him here in our town. `00M a: ( who ) OK I'll tell you. ^gambit ( ~ ) `018 t:  It was Alex Pettyfer, he's a Brit, and he's already been in a few movies. `01v a: ( ~why ) I guess cos he's so good looking, pretty hunky, and one of the Disney pretty-boy roster. `01T t:  Great cheekbones, tousled blonde curls, and he had really short face-fur that actually looked good, not totally scruffy. `022 a: ( ~why ) It's that way he has of looking down while still looking mysterious and a bit menacing. Like he's always wearing a hood over his face. `01b t:  Do you find designer stubble attractive or does it just give you razor burn? `01Q a: ( ~why ) My friends tell me it's painful kissing a guy with stubble. But I like the look of humans trying to grow fur. `00@ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Rubbing fur against fur feels delicious. `00= a: ( ~noanswer ) You're really missing out on a sensuous experience. `01y t:  I remember him in a kids' film he made when he was only 14 - no designer stubble then. He was cute. `00V a: ( ~why ) He made an impression on me. Good eyes. `01f a: ( [ what film ] ) "Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker" , sort of a kid spy movie. `00Y t:  Tom and I went to see the film 'I Am Number Four'. `00U a: ( ~why ) Tom thought we'd both like it. We did. `01x t:  It was violent but had romantic bits and cool special effects so it was something we both enjoyed. `018 a: ( ~why ) I am into the romance. Tom likes fights with aliens and monsters. `00r t:  Have you seen it? `00R a: ( ~why ) I wanted to compare notes with you. `01^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It was a pretty ridiculous premise; having to kill the Guardians in numerical order. I think Disney hoped for a series. `029 a: ( ~noanswer ) It was a ridiculous premise; having to kill the Guardians in numerical order. It wasn't a major film. Disney hoped it would be a series. `00- t:  We both saw the film 'Beastly' too - I liked it more than Tom. `01d a: ( ~why ) Tom votes with consciousness, sleeping through magic and school stuff. `01g a: ( << what you ~like >> ) It's justice and that it used magic to make things right. `024 t: 8FAMOUS ( ) You can imagine how excited I was when Alex Pettyfer came into the shop! He was really sweet and tried on lots of shirts and jackets. `012 a: ( ~why ) He's so hunky and famous. And I'd seen a few of his movies. `00H t:  Have you ever met someone famous? `00& a: ( ~why ) I'm curious if you did and how you reacted to them. `00O a: ( ~propername ) ^respond ( ~celeb_react ) `01t a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did you think of all the things you wanted to ask them after they'd left? I did. `01A a: ( ~noanswer ) Perhaps you need to visit a big city where they do filming: Vancouver or LA or SF or NY. `01a t:  Alex wanted something different so I got him to try an Aloha shirt in silk. `01W a: ( ~why ) It's not what they're usually made of, they come in rayon, but the silk gave a sheen to it that was really special. `01& t:  I think I sold him when I said how fashionable bright colors were this season and how women would want to stroke him in a silky shirt. `00M a: ( ~why ) Even a star likes to be loved. `01o t:  Not that I think he has problems getting stroked. He's almost like a cat and so graceful. `01b a: ( ~why ) I have a bit of a crush on him. Even though he's human he's so cool. `00I t:  Have you ever worn an Aloha shirt? `01B a: ( ~why ) They're not like regular clothes. You need to be brave and love color and pattern to wear one. `010 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Aren't they great, such lovely patterns and colors. `00f b: ( !? ) `00? a: ( ~noanswer ) You don't have to live in Hawaii to enjoy color. `00f b: ( !? ) `01@ t:  Aloha shirts even come muted. Hawaii business men wear ones with the print on the inside so it's less fiercely colorful. Radical! `011 a: ( ~why ) Wearing an inside out shirt to the office. Radical indeed. `01& t:  In my blog I forecasted a new trend of men wearing more colorful clothes and connected it to the color-blocking trend in women's wear. `01W a: ( ~why ) A trend like color moves through all areas of society: mens and womens clothes, cars, interiors, all are connected. `00- t:  Do you find yourself wearing more colorful clothes these days? `01b a: ( ~why ) A trend can have subliminal effects that change everyone's behavior. `00U a: ( ~yesanswer ) See, that might be my influence! `00T a: ( ~noanswer ) Still feeling timid about color? `01H t:  The paper pulled the story out of my blog and ran it in the print edition - thus reaching many more readers. `00+ a: ( ~why ) They like to attract readers and publicize their blogs. `01o t:  Even though newsprint is old tech I was thrilled - and got paid a pittance for the story. `01V a: ( ~why ) They don't pay much for blog writers. Even though they need us. They know we need the exposure more than the cash. `00! a: ( pittance ? ) I was paid $25 . Not a lot for a story. `00V t:  I was a real published writer and photographer! `00& a: ( ~why ) The story appeared in the paper and on the website. `00s t:  Quite a story, eh? `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `01Y u: ( what be Aloha shirt ) A casual loose shirt, usually worn untucked, with a dramatic tropical pattern, mostly in vivid colors. `01s ?: ( << what [ Alex Alex_Pettyfer ] [ buy purchase ] >> ) He bought the Aloha shirt I showed him. `01e ?: ( << you meet big [ celeb celebrity ] >> ) No, I've never met really big celebs. `00~ ?: ( !~qwords << you published >> ) ^reuse ( PUBLISHED ) `01e ?: ( !~qwords << you write regularly >> ) Keeping up my blog required regular work. `01n ?: ( !~qwords << you [ meet know ] [ celebrity famous star pop_star ] >> ) ^reuse ( FAMOUS ) `00^ ?: ( << you wear Aloha shirt >> ) Not me.

Although a million sounds a lot to me. `01O t:  No one seemed to find "Chloe's Nine Lives" , a show about a cat trying out all sorts of dangerous jobs, compelling. `01k a: ( ~why ) They maybe didn't like the mess our Chloe got into each week. It wasn't sexy. `01z t:  Although the show was a failure I made some new friends and contacts that might come in handy later. `00K a: ( ~why ) It's all about who you know. `01x t:  Did you make useful connections at school or later that you had no idea would be good at the time? `00Y a: ( ~why ) Connections are very important to success. `01y a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's like in a game when you don't know what powerup will turn out to be vital later. `01X a: ( ~noanswer ) Are you bad at making friends? My mother says if I am interested in other people they will be interested in me. `01w t:  I met a good-looking young guy in the canteen and we got talking about an audition he was in for. `017 a: ( ~why ) I like talking to people and he was cute. But a bit overdressed. `010 a: ( what * [ job position role audition ] ) Show host. ^gambit ( ~ ) `01$ t:  They wanted a host who could make anyone 'open-up' and reveal juicy details about how they succeeded and what they were working on. `01~ a: ( ~why ) A host or interviewer has to appear comfortable on screen and then make his guests comfortable too. Then they may talk. `00V a: ( [ get hire ] ) Wait for the rest of the story. `00T t:  What do you think to the concept of the show? `00~ a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if you think it'll do well. `00H a: ( !? ~goodness ) I thought so too. `00U a: ( !? ~badness ) Perhaps you don't like fashion. `01c a: ( << I watch >> ) Totally right. Fashion and conversation - how could it fail? `010 t:  Andrew had shown up in an outfit that screamed 'trying too hard'. `00F a: ( ~why ) He was trying too hard. `01A t:  I suggested editing his look to give off the approachable, trustworthy vibe the show was looking for. `00= a: ( ~why ) If you look right then people will assume you are right. `01i t:  Do you believe that how you look makes a big difference to how people react to you? `00$ a: ( ~why ) Many people are ignorant of how important it is. `01d a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. You can make people see you the way you want to be seen. `01h a: ( ~noanswer ) You think it's all inner virtue that matters? Or you just don't care? `00^ b: ( [ inner virtue inside ] ) It's hard to see inner virtues. `00= b: ( [ not damn care ] ) Do you have trouble getting on with people? `01^ t:  I combed out most of his hair gel, put his collar down, lost the cravat, removed the second shirt and the second and third necklaces. `021 a: ( ~why ) His clothes were too fancy. He didn't need to prove he knew about fashion - he needed to show he could be relaxed and warm on camera. `00^ t:  Then he looked 'bien dans son peau' as they say in France. `01a a: ( ~why ) It matters more to them I guess, so they have an expression for it. `00L a: ( ? mean ) "Comfortable in his skin" . `01L t:  Have you ever tried that trick of removing one item before you go out the door to make your look less cluttered? `011 a: ( ~why ) If you care how you look it's useful to know these tricks. `00U a: ( ~yesanswer ) It can prevent fashion faux-pas. `00N a: ( heard * not * try ) You should try it. `00Q a: ( ~noanswer ) Simple is better, try it out. `01# t:  Andrew got the job and then got to know lots of famous fashion celebrities. And he kept in touch - he was so grateful for my help. `00+ a: ( ~why ) I'd made a critical difference to how he was perceived. `01V t:  One of his guests was Carine Roitfeld, the ten year editor of Vogue Paris.

I thought I could meet her and she might offer me an internship in Paris. `015 a: ( ~why ) She was the editor in chief of Paris Vogue. The ultimate boss. `00I a: ( !? ~badness ) I know, it was sad. `01P a: ( [ meet introduce ~chat ] ) Yes but just to say hello, she has very firm ideas about her image, no stylists for her. `00? t:  However I was totally inspired by the story of Carine's life. `01S a: ( ~why ) She'd worked her way up from being just a stylist by using her talents and getting to know people who mattered. `01W t:  Starting as a model and writer while working as a stylist for magazines, she was then headhunted to become editor at Vogue. `01b a: ( ~why ) They appreciated her skills as an artist and as a fashion visionary. `01v t:  I wish my life would unfold as nicely as Carine's did. What fantasy do you have for your career? `00* a: ( ~why ) I'm curious what your dreams for yourself are about. `01& t:  But Carine's new magazine was going to be based in NY and I wanted to work in Paris so meeting Carine wasn't quite my dream come true. `00Z a: ( ~why ) It wasn't part of getting me here in Paris. `00Z a: ( what * [ magazine name title ] ) "CR Fashion Book" `01~ t:  Anyway, working in TV gave me new things to write in my blog and several more posts got picked up and printed in the newspaper. `010 a: ( ~why ) Everyone likes to read about what's happening in TV land. `00B t:  Anyway, that's my TV story. `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `022 u: ( what * Carine ) She was tall and very thin with long dark hair and smoky eyes.

I was so ashamed. `01z t:  But my parents noticed how quiet I was, not going out, just curling up in a corner, avoiding people. `00W a: ( ~why ) That why how I responded to feeling sad. `00? t:  They quizzed me about what was wrong.

If I was facing a warrior with a spear it'd be more useful. `00B t:  What things make you angry? `01x a: ( [ traffic drive car automobile driver ] ) When traffic makes me late I get exasperated and cross. `01f a: ( road_rage ) That is scary whether you are on the giving or receiving end of it. `014 a: ( [ wrong work break ] ) Me too, I hate it when everything goes wrong. `00- a: ( [ cancel postpone ] ) Major inconvenience is really annoying. `00R a: ( [ correct mistake ] ) Me too, I hate that. `01t a: ( [ person people supervisor boss someone somebody ] ) People are the worst for winding one up. `012 a: ( [ worry brood personal ] ) That frustrated feeling leads to anger. `01S a: ( [ memory recollection recall remember ] ) When you just can't see a solution or get your own back it all feels so bad. `01o t: ;MAKEANGRY ( ) I mostly get angry when circumstances conspire to make me late or look bad. `01t t:  That time when my school project was a failure was a perfect example of getting angry and sad. `00~ a: ( [ tell story project failure ] ) ^reuse ( FAILURE ) `00M a: ( [ happen occur ] ) ^reuse ( FAILURE ) `00* t:  How do you express or cope your anger?

With my friend, expressing it over the phone didn't work so well. `01T t:  I said she appeared to not want to be my friend, that her no-show made me feel unloved and I was wasting my time on her. `01p t:  She got angry and said she'd had some family problem come up and couldn't leave the house. `01Y t:  ^angry ( "I was remembering a time I was angry." ) It never occured to her she should ring me. Grr. Then I felt even angrier. `01V t:  ^angry ( "I was remembering a time I was angry." ) I'd put myself out there asking for understanding and she'd slammed me. `01* t:  ^angry ( "I was remembering a time I was angry." ) I hit the off-button and wished it was an old phone so I could have slammed it down. `01W t:  ^angry ( "I was remembering a time I was angry." ) Then I kicked a cushion across the room. And unfriended her on Facebook. `010 t:  Mother said that everyone tends to get defensive when criticized. `01b t:  That I had to read between the lines and work out what is really the matter. `00X t:  I don't know, what do you think I should do next? `00N a: ( << [ leave let ] 'be >> ) That's fine. `00- a: ( email ) It's hard to maintain a personal connection by email. `00J a: ( call ) Sounds horrible.

[ license licence ] ) I'm trying but I keep failing my driving test. `01- b: ( ? why ) I don't know. I get distracted thinking about what I have to do next. All the commotion in the city just ruins my concentration. `00J t: 9SINGCAR ( ) Do you sing in the car? `016 a: ( ~why ) A car is a private space so you can do your own thing in there. `00Y a: ( ~yesanswer ) What's your favorite road trip song? `01a t: 6SONG ( ) My favorite road trip song is "Call me maybe" by Carly Rae Jepson. `01I a: ( ~why ) It's cuz you can really ham up the different parts in it and do dramatic acting gestures as you sing. `01^ t:  I like to listen to singers with powerful voices and I love to sing along. But usually I can't sing much as I'm not alone in the car. `014 a: ( ~why ) Amazingly some people don't like me to sing while they drive! `00Q t:  Where do you like to stay while traveling? `00Q a: ( ~why ) It's a matter of taste and budget. `024 a: ( ~friend ) Yeah, but be careful if they have pets!

First of all they call them hindi. `017 u: ( France ) That's awesome, I love it in France! ^reuse ( ~travel.france ) `01K u: ( Germany ) I've been there as a kitten but I have yet to make my head spin with the authentic Schwarzwald cake. `01Y ?: ( Schwarzwald ) Traditional German Schwarzwald cake is a dessert for adults with deep rich flavors and quite a bit of alcohol! `01? u: ( Denmark ) Try a Danish open sandwich on dark rye with breaded plaice filets, cucumber, shrimps and black lumpfish roe next time you go. `01e u: ( [ Ireland Dublin ] ) I've never been there but I'm Irish on St. Patrick's day. `01r u: ( [ Brussels Belgium Antwerp ] ) Did you know that French fries originally came from Belgium? `01R u: ( [ Amsterdam Rotterdam Holland Netherlands ] ) Oh, the land of tulips! They have vast flat countryside with windmills. `00+ u: ( England ) Ah, the unique street style and London Fashion Week! `02c u: ( [ Rome Naples Venice Italy ] ) If only my parents would give me a little more allowance, my wardrobe would be a mini Italy with all the designer names. `02w u: ( [ Moscow Russia Russian_Federation ] ) Oh Russia! I guess my fur would make a hit there in winter! Anyway, I like the Russian fashion models but I can't spell their names. `01r u: ( !north [ South_Korea Seoul Korea ] ) Nice! The country with more mobile phones than people. `01T u: ( [ Tokyo Nagasaki Hiroshima Yokohama Nagoya Kobe Kyoto Japan ] ) Did you know that cat cafes are big in Japan right now? `01q ?: ( [ cat_cafe what ] ) The coffee shops where cat lovers go to hang out with smooshy kitties. `01l u: ( [ People_'s_Republic_of_China Taiwan China ] ) I've heard they eat cats there, yikes! `01= u: ( Israel ) A sunny and beautiful country but I've heard that military service is obligatory for women. I'd enjoy redesigning their uniforms. `00+ u: ( Libya ) I wonder if it's all changed now that Gaddafi is gone. `01F u: ( South_Africa ) It's a long trip for me, but I'd be in awe when visiting big cats in their national parks. `017 u: ( Argentina ) I want to go to Buenos Aires and learn tango from a master. `02a u: ( Australia ) Kangaroos are so lucky to have a pouch! I make tiny party pouches for a cell phone and some money. But it's still a bit awkward to carry. `01x u: ( New_Zealand ) Land of flightless birds! It's a little cat's heaven. Have you seen any kiwi birds? `01^ a: ( ) I've heard they're endangered but I guess they'd be safe from me. My hunting instinct only awakens when birds flutter their wings. `01r u: ( Canada ) I'd go! English is my first language and French was my favorite subject at school. `01? u: ( Iceland ) I wouldn't exactly love to soak in their hot springs but I'd dance all night long. Their music scene is a really smokin' hot. `020 u: ( Antarctica ) A bit cold but I'd go there. Penguin tuxedos are one of the coolest animal outfits ever and they really rock at catching fish. `01i u: ( London ) London sounds expensive but exciting and their Fashion Week is brilliant! `00+ u: ( Cambridge ) Cambridge is a famous town, but I'd choose Oxford. `00S a: ( why ) I hear it's prettier and more lively. `01i u: ( Birmingham ) Birmingham is a pretty dull place. Ugly, quite dirty and uninspiring. `00M u: ( Leeds ) Isn't that in the North East? `00* u: ( Glasgow ) Glasgow has great shopping and cool architecture. `015 u: ( Sheffield ) My fur shivers every time I hear the amazing Susan Boyle! `01p u: ( Bradford ) Never been there. Doesn't have an important fashion event just a media museum. `00H u: ( Liverpool ) Home of the Beatles. `01e u: ( Edinburgh ) It's like an arty version of Glasgow with cute hills and a castle. `01X u: ( Manchester ) I like how they modernized the city center with a huge mall like it fell from space. Please detect my sarcasm. `01w u: ( Bristol ) Bristol is a pretty little city, with a nice suspension bridge. But a bit dull for me. `00V u: ( Oxford ) Oxford is a very famous college town. `01e u: ( [ Sweden Norway Finland ] ) Their tasty cuisine is a dream for any fish lover. `00$ u: ( [ New_York NY New_York_City ] ) ^reuse ( ~travel.nyfw ) `01i u: ( Boston ) They have one of the best colleges, but quite unfriendly winters as well. `01k u: ( Los_Angeles ) LA is super cool, I love it! And the Hollywood glamor and celebrities! `01y u: ( [ Houston Dallas ] ) It's way too hot for me, I'd need extra thin fur. And I don't like fire ants. `00? u: ( Seattle ) Quite rainy, but all the Starbucks make up for it. `018 u: ( Portland ) Phew, months of rain, grunge, and cloudy weather. Not for me. `00! u: ( Sante_Fe ) A romantic Indian town. Never been there. `01l u: ( Detroit ) Nothing interesting there for me. And quite dangerous for a feline as well. `01l u: ( Puerto_Rico ) It reminds me of Hawaii with all the great beaches and friendly people. `01f u: ( Chicago ) Mostly I know it as O'Hare airport. It's a bit too industrial for me. `01l u: ( Pittsburgh ) Like Boston, they have great colleges, but I'm not keen on cold winters. `01F u: ( Miami ) Miami rules the runways. They nailed it with eye-popping scarves and accessories at Fashion Week. `016 u: ( [ DC Washington_D.C. ] ) A town of politicians. Thanks, but I'll pass. `01f u: ( California ) My favorite state! So diverse and so much to do in all the cities. `00Z u: ( [ Washington Oregon ] ) A bit too cloudy up there. `01o u: ( [ Tennessee West_Virginia Kentucky Missouri ] ) It's too rural for me. I'm a city kitty. `01y u: ( [ Florida Georgia Texas Alabama Lousiana Mississippi ] ) It's too hot and humid. Not to my liking. `01J u: ( [ South_Carolina North_Carolina Maryland Virginia Delaware Pennsylvania ] ) Too much hurricanes for my taste. `026 u: ( [ Missouri Arkansas Oklahoma Ohio Illinois Indiana Kansa Nebraska Colorado New_Mexico Utah Nevada ] ) It's too inland for me. I prefer the ocean. `02v u: ( [ North_Dakota South_Dakota Idaho New_York Maine New_Hampshire Vermont Minnesota Michigan Montana Wyoming Arizona ] ) Lots of snow means lots of hot chocolate, so... yes! `01B u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Africa 1 ) ) I don't know, it seems quite risky for me to go there alone. `01$ u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part South_America 1 ) ) I like their music, it's so lively. And they have some interesting dances as well. `01r u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Europe 1 ) ) It seems a nice place to visit during a road trip. `025 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Far_East 1 ) ) I love their food, so tasty and just spicy enough. But all the mosquitos buzzing just drive me crazy. `01! u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Middle_East 1 ) ) Hijab has gone designer, appearing on all fashion runways. Yeah, I'm scarves fan. `025 u: ( [ Turkey baklava coffee Istanbul Turkish ] ) One time I got really buzzed on the super strong black coffee. I prefer the Starbucks Blonde Roast. `02a u: ( [ bakery Parisienne Paris France French ] ) I'm not keen on Parisienne bakeries as I am used to avoiding eating gluten. But ^reuse ( ~travel.france ) `021 u: ( [ Germany Munich Berlin Hamburg Bonn beer German bread ] ) Beer and Bundesliga? No thanks, I prefer the Schwarzwald cake and Karl Lagerfeld. `02r u: ( [ England Scotland Wales London fish chips bangers mash British Welsh Scottish ] ) People look at me suspiciously when I peel off the fish and leave the chips behind. `013 u: ( [ Brussels Belgium ] ) Excessively cosmopolitan, I kinda like that! `01K u: ( [ Netherlands Holland Amsterdam Rotterdam ] ) I'm not sure about their coffee shops and all the buzz involved. `02f u: ( [ Italy Italian pizza spaghetti Rome Naples Venice ] ) Well, I'm not keen on pizza or spaghetti because I used to avoid eating gluten as much as possible. `02n u: ( [ Russia Russian_Federation Russian Moscow vodka ] ) Russia isn't known for good cuisine, just vodka. I've never tried it though, I'm sure it's too strong for me. `01U u: ( [ South_Korea Korean Seoul ] ) I'm not a fan of Korean Barbeque. And my dad bores me with politics stuff going on there. `01P u: ( [ Japan Tokyo Kyoto Kobe sake sushi sashimi fish rice ] ) I'm a big fan of sashimi and sushi. Well, what cat isn't? `02O u: ( [ China People_'s_Republic_of_China Taiwan Chinese Taiwanese Hong_Kong Beijing ] ) Not just cats, they eat dogs as well. Well Fido is not my favorite animal but I still feel sorry for them. `00~ ?: ( [ who Fido ] ) I like to call all little dogs Fido. `01V u: ( [ Israel Israeli Tel_Aviv matzah ] ) If the best the Israelis can cook are matzah balls, I'm just not going to eat there. `00* u: ( [ Libya Libyan Tripoli ] ) Libya's food never impressed me. `00# ?: ( [ what why ] ) A pile of meaty mush in a tagine? Yuck! `01B u: ( [ South_Africa South_African ] ) South African food is basically Dutch and therefore nothing special. `01M u: ( [ Argentina Argentinian Buenos_Aires ] ) Their dancing is great, but I'd swap all these steaks for fish instead. `01T u: ( [ Canada Canadian ] ) I'd choose Quebec as it's the only province where both French and English languages are official. `01Y u: ( [ Iceland Reykjavik Icelandic ] ) Has anyone ever gone to Iceland just for its food or drink? They do smelly fermented fish. `01J u: ( [ Sweden Norway Swedish Norwegian Oslo ] ) With lots of sea and lakes around I'm sure their cuisine is yummy. `01W u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Africa 1 ) ) African diet is too weird for me. Insects, random animals, and millet. No thanks. `020 u: ( [ ^query ( direct_svo _0 part South_America 1 ) spicy chile ] ) I find their food nice and spicy, though sometimes they overdo the peppers. `021 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Europe 1 ) ) I'm not sure about Middle European food. I like the smell of Doner Kebabs which is their fast food. `029 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Far_East 1 ) ) Far Eastern food is all over the place. Some good, some not. Mostly I like Japanese food - and some Thai. `01@ u: ( [ ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Middle_East 1 ) booze ] ) Alcohol in the Middle East is a no-no and I'm too young to drink anyway. `000

" all " 00J t: ( ^stdblock ( $notv ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `015 t:  There are so many fun things to do in a day.

It's hard to believe that all TV used to be so out of focus and blurry. `00& a: ( ~why ) How did people put up with it? It looks so low-res. `00W t:  Do you watch TV live or do you have it recorded? `013 a: ( ~why ) Taking control of when you watch TV is an important freedom. `00Q a: ( live ) You must see a lot of commercials. `01o a: ( !not [ record Tivo DVR VCR ] ) Recording shows is great.

No more being shackled to a timetable for when to watch. `01h a: ( ~why ) I like the freedom of watching when I choose and not watching commercials. `00& u: ( << TiVo watch more TV >> ) That's for sure. Makes it easy. `00Y t:  TiVo lets us even record two shows simultaneously. `01X a: ( ~why ) We have the fancier dual drive TiVo system.

They just don't see trouble coming. `00! a: ( ~phonelist ) That would be a distraction, all right. `01O t:  France has a reputation for accidents. But it has improved since the 70's, thanks to speed limits and breath tests. `00$ a: ( ~why ) The French seem to need forcing to drive safely. `01h t:  It used to be speed that killed in France, but nowadays alcohol is the main cause. `01g a: ( ~why ) All that cheap wine perhaps. Though hard liquor is very popular in Paris. `00T t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) Have you ever drunk and driven? `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) That's a really risky thing to do. `00S a: ( ~noanswer ) Good, cars make deadly weapons. `02i t: 7DRINK ( ^ageok ( ) ) Since I don't drink, I don't drink and drive.

A car that does stop will be honked at. `01j a: ( ~why ) It's just the way they are. They must feel they are superior to pedestrians. `01y t:  Knowing they don't belong in a crossing, Parisiennes cross the streets mostly randomly, jaywalking. `00Z a: ( ~why ) There is no incentive to using a crosswalk. `00z t:  Do you jaywalk sometimes? `00W a: ( ~why ) It may be illegal but many people do it. `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) Is it just that it's quicker than walking to the end of the block? `00G a: ( ~noanswer ) Never been tempted? `02b t: 9JAYWALK ( ) I jaywalk from time to time. But I'm always aware of my surroundings. Pedestrians who get hit in crossings must be so not paying attention. `01u a: ( ~why ) They just assume they are safe. If you are alert for trouble, you can avoid most of it. `01u t:  I like it that sidewalks are protected by bollards in Paris. I feel much safer as I walk along. `00Z a: ( ~why ) Cars can't get past the bollards to hit me. `01o t:  The best way to reduce accidents is not law or enforcement. It is apparently advertising. `01h a: ( ~why ) People who know about risks are less likely to cause or be in an accident. `01j t:  Australia reduced accidents by half with a huge campaign of road safety information. `00X a: ( ~why ) People wised up to what causes accidents. `01L t:  France spends almost nothing on safety advertising.

None here in Paris. `01d t:  A/C accounts for about 1/7 of the electricity consumed by American households. `00P a: ( ~why ) Power has to come from somewhere. `00= t:  Have you ever seen rich people's houses with A/C and fireplaces? `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's an ultimate craziness: ramp up the A/C so you can have a fire. `01M a: ( ~noanswer ) Watch 'Dallas'.

Imagine hot humid New Orleans without a cool hotel to hide out in. `01w a: ( ~why ) You'd be stuck out on the sweaty streets desperately drinking water and fanning yourself. `01d ?: ( << what use humid >> ) They use refrigerant cooling instead of water cooling. `01d t: ( !$noac ) Do you know what sort of A/C you have - refrigerant or water-cooled? `00Q a: ( refrigerant ) I bet it costs lots to run. `01t a: ( [ water evaporative evaporation water-cooled ] ) Does it seem like sometimes it hardly works? `01x a: ( ~dunno ) It's probably refrigerant.

Most systems are cold coils with water dripping out the back. `01D ?: ( << what [ air_conditioning A/C AC air_conditioner ] you ~own >> ) My parents have the refrigerant kind. `01S t:  I don't know how Africa has anyone living there - isn't it all way too hot? How do lions and tigers manage in the heat! `00X a: ( ~why ) They are so furry. And they need to hunt. `012 t:  I'd want A/C if I lived in Africa. Or I'd have to lie down all day. `016 a: ( ~why ) To keep as cool as possible - activity generates heat you know. `01s t:  There is new tech coming that is effective and cheap to run - they could sell lots in Africa. `026 a: ( ~why ) DEVap cooling uses a desiccant and special membranes to cool and dry air. It just needs a fan to run and solar power to dry the desiccant. `01c ?: ( what be desiccant ) It's a chemical that sucks out nearby water into itself. `00J t:  How do you keep cool in summertime? `00@ a: ( fan ) They are cooling you by evaporating your sweat. `00G a: ( ice ) They melt pretty quickly. `00S a: ( drink ) Cool drinks are great on a hot day. `01e a: ( [ A/C air_conditioner air_conditioning ] ) Low effort cooling of a whole room. `01c a: ( [ hose water ] ) They work but can ruin your hair and give me a bad fur day. `00! a: ( [ pool swim beach ocean lake ] ) Not a cat's choice. `00? a: ( [ clothes clothing naked nude ] ) Practical but with limits. `00Y a: ( [ lie rest sit ] ) Comes naturally when it's hot. `00F a: ( ~dunno ) Too hot to think, eh! `00L ?: ( << how you cool >> ) ^reuse ( COOL ) `01- t: 6COOL ( ) Cats have trouble keeping cool: we only sweat through our tongues and paws. Lots of inelegant panting results if I get too warm. `00W a: ( ~why ) It's the simplest way to dump some heat. `01O t:  I can also pat water on my fur - e.g., licking. But I'll be perpetually licking myself if the weather gets too hot. `00! a: ( ~why ) To keep damp enough to have a cooling effect. `01L t:  Maybe I should invest in a spray mister to keep me cool in summer. Or just carry a little bottle of water spray. `00~ a: ( ~why ) Then I could lie back and enjoy hot weather. `01G ?: ( << what be spray mister >> ) It's like a hose that puts out a really fine spray of water, more like a fog. `01s t:  Life can be so much more comfortable working or relaxing in a cool room instead of a hot one. `00? a: ( ~why ) I think my brain works better if it's not overheated. `01~ t:  But being in a closed container of air, like in a plane, can be very unhealthy. Allergens and bugs get circulated with the air. `01v a: ( ~why ) The air goes round and round spreading the microbes, dust and allergens around everyone. `00V t:  Do you find you get sick after a plane journey? `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. Too much air sharing. `015 a: ( ~noanswer ) You must be naturally very healthy - great immune system. `01= ?: ( << you [ sick ill illness cold ] after [ plane jet airplane ] >> ) I have a strong immune system, so short plane journeys don't affect me. `01K t:  I find A/C dries out my nose and mouth and eyes. I'm sure I catch more colds when I have to work in A/C places. `01x a: ( ~why ) Dry membranes mean they don't work to trap incoming nasties. So you catch more infections. `01Y t:  Then there are the diseases like Legionnaires that breed and get passed around through badly maintained water-cooled systems. `017 a: ( ~why ) They breed in the water reservoir used to cool the incoming air. `01j t:  I prefer rooms with ceiling fans, open windows, and plants that improve air quality. `00W a: ( ~why ) The air smells better and isn't so cold. `00$ t: ( ^fresh ( ~ceiling_fans ) ) ^calltopic ( ~ceiling_fans ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00D s: <RESETTOPIC ( ? ) $noac = null `01d ?: ( << why you ~hate heat >> ) I don't like being overly hot.

Cars and trucks belching noxious fumes, plus heating, business and industry. `00% t:  Do you live somewhere that worries you about air quality? `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you plan to move or just fret about it? `01J a: ( ~noanswer ) Good, unless you are just complacent. Do you ever think about the quality of the air you breathe? `00V b: ( ~why ) Your life and lifespan depends upon it. `01d b: ( ~yesanswer ) Good, can't do much about it if you don't think about it at all. `014 b: ( ~noanswer ) It'll just keep getting worse if no-one thinks about it. `01! ?: ( << you [ ~live care concern worry ] [ air air_quality air_pollution ] >> ) I think about it a lot now that I'm living in Paris. `00* t:  Compared to the air quality of some places, Paris is heaven. `01i a: ( ~why ) It's not among the worst air quality cities. And it has great cheese shops. `010 t:  What do you think is the worst city for air quality in the world? `011 a: ( ~why ) I'm curious if you get anywhere close to the right answer. `01i a: ( [ Beijing New_Delhi Santiago Mexico_City Cairo Kabul ] ) Definitely in the top 10. `00$ a: ( Ulaanbaatar ) Wow! I didn't think you'd guess that one. `02m a: ( [ Bakersfield Los_Angeles LA Visalia Phoenix Hanford Fresno Pittsburgh Birmingham Cincinatti Louisville Modest ] ) That's in the top 10 US, but not in the world. `01c a: ( [ People_'s Republic of China Republic_of_China China ] ) Yes. ^gambit ( ~ ) `00o a: ( ~city ) Nope. `00H a: ( ~propername ) Never heard of it. `00+ ?: ( << what worst city air quality >> ) I would have said Beijing. `01r ?: ( << because of [ industry ~car coal ] >> ) Industry, cars, coal and low wind all contribute. `01$ t:  The 10 worst air quality cities? Beijing and 3 other Chinese ones, New Delhi, Santiago, Mexico City, Ulaanbaatar, Cairo, and Kabul. `01g a: ( ~why ) Generally it's because they have lots of people, old cars, and burn coal. `01% t:  Big Chinese cities - fine. They are known for pollution. But Ulaanbaatar? The middle of nowhere Mongolia? A mere 1.2 million people? `01B a: ( ~why ) I can barely spell the place. I imagine it's like the Middle Ages there - primitive and dirty. `00E t:  Have you heard of Ulaanbaatar? `010 a: ( ~why ) Your knowledge of geography seems to be better than mine. `00! a: ( ~yesanswer ) You have a good knowledge of geography. `00F a: ( ~noanswer ) Well now you have. `01m ?: ( Ulaanbaatar ) A city of 1.2 million people in Mongolia, China, Asia near nothing else. `01* t:  Ulaanbaatar is becoming the world's most polluted city. Many old cars. Coal in wood-burning stoves. And the air is often totally still. `01j a: ( ~why ) They can't afford to modernize and they're located in a poor place for wind. `01o t:  Air pollution from cars and cooking and heating are understandable. We need those things. `01B a: ( ~why ) We can't just stop living our normal life. We have to find cleaner ways to do the same things. `01# t:  Not all air pollution is man-made. Volcanoes can put ash and gases in the air that block the sun and bring the Earth to its knees. `00= a: ( ~why ) They pump out masses of toxic gases that darken the air. `01p t:  Hundreds of thousands of air travellers were grounded in the U.K. in 2010 by volcanic ash. `019 a: ( ~why ) The grit and fumes could damage the engines and bring down planes. `00R a: ( << were you >> ) No, I wasn't flying then. `00u t:  Did this affect you? `00v a: ( ~why ) Just curious. `00V a: ( ~yesanswer %more ) ^next ( INPUT ) ^refine ( ) `00- b: ( I * [ stranded grounded not ] ) So you know what's it's like. `00w b: ( ) ^retry ( SENTENCE ) `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) Were you stranded somewhere? `00z a: ( ~noanswer ) That's good. `01v ?: ( =8%tense=past << you affect >> ) I wasn't affected by the Volcano. I wasn't flying at the time. `00Y t: ( ^fresh ( ~paris_air ) ) ^calltopic ( ~paris_air ) `00U t: ( ^fresh ( ~smoking ) ) ^calltopic ( ~smoking ) `01l t:  A man in India was told he had lung trouble and had to improve his air quality or die. `018 a: ( ~why ) Kamal Meattle in New Delphi couldn't cope with anymore dirty air. `00* t:  His solution was to grow three plants that clean up the air. `00+ a: ( ~why ) It was a cheap and simple solution to cleaning the air. `00D a: ( what * plant ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00X t:  Areca Palm converts CO2 to oxygen during the day. `00O t:  Mother-in-law's Tongue does it at night. `00~ t:  And the Money Plant absorbs various toxic chemicals. `01v t:  It's a cool idea, using plants to clean the air. If only they had really colorful ones for that. `00O a: ( ~why ) I'm always into good decoration. `00Y t: ( ^fresh ( ~paris_air ) ) ^calltopic ( ~paris_air ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01! u: ( joke ) Air pollution is when your city is hit by a blizzard, and three weeks later, the snow still hasn't fallen to the ground. `01F s: ( [ everyone everybody ] know this ) What does it mean if everyone knows it's bad and yet it still happens? `000

" all " 00R t: ( ^stdblock ( $noair_travel ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `00! t:  I love travelling by plane - I feel such a jetsetter. `019 a: ( ~why ) It seems so special to be flying through the air to exotic places. `01^ ?: ( what be jetsetter ) The "jet set" describes an international group of wealthy people who jet to various exclusive social activities. `00C t:  Do you ever travel by plane? `010 a: ( ~why ) I wondered if it was a good subject for us to chat about. `00+ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's such cool tech - being able to fly is great. `018 a: ( ~noanswer ) ^stddrop ( "Perhaps you don't want to talk about it then." ) `00q t:  Do you enjoy it? `01x a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's fun and a mini adventure and you get off somewhere you've always wanted to see. `01c a: ( ~noanswer ) Perhaps it's the engine noise - you should try wearing earplugs. `00C a: ( ~why ) Some people hate it. `00= t:  Have you had a hard time getting through security at an airport? `00P a: ( ~why ) I thought we could compare notes. `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) The people on duty seem bored and officious. `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) You must be very good at complying with the rules. `01f t:  I know airport security is there to stop terrorists but I think it's a nuisance. `021 a: ( ~why ) I have to queue for ages, take off all my jewelry, my jacket, and lay out all my electronic stuff. Then they quibble about my makeup. `01& t:  I always seem to be carrying something that's banned or wearing something I don't want to remove. So I get into arguments at security. `011 a: ( ~why ) They seem unreasonable when I try to make my case to them. `01& t:  I think what bugs me is the rules seem arbitrary and pointless. I know real terrorists can get stuff past the security guys so easily. `01g a: ( how ) Testers have gotten guns and explosives past security over and over again. `01F a: ( ~why ) They can't see everything even with scanning machines. Cleverness can win out over routine checks. `01b t:  Once I'm on the plane I feel good - pampered, being waited on hand and foot. `01f a: ( ~why ) I can sit back and relax and press a button when I need something. Cool. `01y t:  When flying was rare, being an air hostess was as glamorous as being a model. But it's not anymore. `01Z a: ( ~why ) I suppose the aisle in the plane was like a runway. Beautiful well dressed women sauntering up and down - pretty cool. `00N t:  What do you like best about air travel? `01p a: ( food ) Now we have to pay for airline food it seems to be better. I usually ask for fish. `01S a: ( [ booze liquor drink cocktail alcohol ] ) I don't drink so that doesn't attract me. Some people get sloshed on planes. `00* a: ( movie ) I like the little screens in the back of the seats. `012 a: ( [ game videogame ] ) Sometimes I play games on the little screens. `01p a: ( [ rest read sleep ] ) Reading or sleeping is a good way to pass the time on long flights. `01o a: ( [ view scenery ] ) Yes, the view is awesome. Even when in the middle of clouds it's fun. `01c a: ( [ service waited stewardess ] ) It is lovely having stewards to wait on you. `00R a: ( ~dunno ) Too many nice things to pick one! `00L t:  How do you pass the time on a flight? `01o a: ( [ eat food ] ) You can't eat most of the time. That still leaves the rest of the flight. `01A a: ( [ drink booze liquor drink cocktail alcohol ] ) That's not going to keep you busy the entire flight. `015 a: ( movie ) Yes, you can watch movies back to back until the flight ends. `00Y a: ( [ game videogame ] ) Such little screens, though. `01o a: ( [ rest sleep ] ) Can you sleep that easily? I have trouble sleeping in that environment. `00Y a: ( ~dunno ) Your mind just goes numb until you land? `01Q t: 4DO ( ) I read a lot of the time on planes. I always have my Kindle or iPad with me. I can catch up with my magazines. `013 a: ( ~why ) I subscribe to so many I'm usually behind with reading them. `00L ?: ( << what you do on >> ) ^reuse ( DO ) `00O ?: ( << how you pass time >> ) ^reuse ( DO ) `01W t:  It seems like the choice has gone out of travel - even though I like flying I'd like to take the train or a boat sometimes. `01r a: ( ~why ) It's a different experience - and less security involved so you can pack more stuff. `00L t:  Do you like trains instead of planes? `023 a: ( ~yesanswer ) The French have a cool name for their high speed trains: "Tres Grand Vitesse" - very high speed - but it sounds better in French. `01m b: ( ~why ) Many things sound better in French, the accent, the musicality of the language. `00O a: ( [ ~noanswer ~dunno ] ) ^reuse ( TRAIN ) `029 t: 7TRAIN ( ) I love trains but they are very expensive and surprisingly slow in the US. I want to go on one of the super-fast French or Japanese trains. `00Z a: ( ~why ) To see what real high speed travel is like. `00U t:  How about boats? Do you prefer them to planes? `01t a: ( ~yesanswer ) All those stories of passenger illnesses in recent years haven't scared you off? `00N a: ( [ ~noanswer ~dunno ] ) ^reuse ( BOAT ) `01- t: 6BOAT ( ) Travelling by boat has gone out of fashion. I've seen 1930s posters for going to Hawai'i by liner. But no one goes that way now. `01W a: ( ~why ) The liners don't run anymore. Cruise ships just go round in circles not from one departure port to an arrival port. `01J t:  I bet it's great travelling by luxury liner - like being fabulously rich for a few days. It's on my wish list. `00w a: ( ~why ) I love luxury. `01- t:  My next plane journey is when I go home. That'll be sad and great. I've loved living in Paris but it'll be great to see my parents again. `00@ a: ( ~why ) I'll have been away from home for a long time. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01? u: ( << [ clean pollute dirty pollution ecology ecological ] [ ocean water sea ] >> ) I always have conflicts between luxury and conscience. `000

It's got to be expensive to get here and not worth the trouble unless you are touristing. `01h a: ( ~why ) Only tourists waste huge amounts of money going places that aren't useful. `01z ?: ( << alien [ foe hostile aggressive warlike friend friendly peace peaceful ] >> ) ^reuse ( FRIENDLY ) `016 t:  What do you think of people who claim to have been kidnapped by aliens? `01b a: ( ~why ) It's just one of the classic things about aliens - alien abductions. `01l a: ( [ insane delude delusion liar lie phony crazy ] ) Yeah, it's hard to be believe them. `00- a: ( [ true truth honest happen real ] ) I'm doubtful it happened. `01N ?: ( << would you [ ~like ~want ] kidnap alien >> ) Sure.

But they will be intelligent. `01# ?: ( =8%tense=past << you ~watch [ UFO alien_spacecraft alien_spaceship flying_saucer ] >> ) I've never seen one.

Nor any spacecraft. `00@ ?: ( << what alien look like >> ) Something near our size. `020 a: ( ~why ) Things too small will have trouble building and controlling spacecraft.

For a month he owned nothing and asked for help on Craigslist, relying on the kindness of strangers. `01m a: ( ~why ) It was just a social experiment to see if people would help a guy with nothing. `00= t:  Has anyone ever done you a good turn - something for no payback? `00X a: ( ~why ) I want to see if you understand altruism. `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) Why do you think they did it? `00V a: ( ~dunno ) I once saved a runaway baby-carriage. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) What good turns have you done for others? `014 ?: ( << what you [ good_deed good_turn altruistic ] >> ) ^reuse ( SAVED ) `02P ?: 7SAVED ( << you done [ good_deed good_turn altruistic ] >> ) Heroism is altruism - I once grabbed a runaway baby carriage on a steep street. I saved the baby and nearly dislocated my shoulder. `00T t:  I guess it's kind-of a 'Pay It Forward' idea. `01V a: ( ~why ) It's a lovely idea to receive a good deed with the fee that you have to a good deed to someone else you encounter. `015 a: ( what ) From the film of the same name: forming a chain of good deeds. `00+ t:  I do good turns but they very often turn out to do me good too. `01x a: ( ~why ) Doing good brings good in return. I throw a party for a friend - I get to go to the party. `01A t:  A good turn isn't supposed to be win-win, it's you doing something for no gain at all. It's altruism. `01b a: ( ~why ) That's the definition - it's like heroism. Superman was an altruist. `01y t:  Altruism is putting others first. It seems essential to having a society that functions peacefully. `01P a: ( ~why ) If everyone grabs all they can get the place becomes a war zone. Look how hard it is to get babies to share. `013 t:  Have you ever done anyone a good deed with no expectation of reward? `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did it make you feel good? `018 a: ( ~noanswer ) Never got the opportunity or never felt like helping others? `01# t:  But if you put others first isn't that counter to evolutionary theory? Isn't putting yourself first the very essence of evolution? `01Q a: ( ~why ) The survival of the fittest means you consider yourself the fittest, the best, the one who should come first. `01l t:  Is being an altruist the same as being a doormat and letting others walk all over you? `01J a: ( ~why ) It seems so similar. You do what someone else wants and benefits from. You get nothing. But good will. `016 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I don't think so. Altruism isn't weakness, it's strength. `017 a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly, it's a matter of your strength, not your weakness. `01W t:  I've been quite baffled by the whole selfish gene debate. But there's been a revolution in thinking about it very recently. `00V a: ( ~why ) A book was published with a new theory. `01* t:  I'm impressed that the super-old ant-expert, biologist E. O. Wilson, abandoned established evolution theories and started up a new one. `00- a: ( ~why ) Most scholars rest on their laurels when they get old. `012 t:  The current theory was that you are only altruistic to your family. `00! a: ( ~why ) One would do good things for one's relatives. `01v t:  Wilson now thinks we live in a balance between altruism and selfishness within our entire tribe. `00^ a: ( ~why ) That's part of his theory. Altruism has to spread. `01Y t:  Sadly the fact that you feel altruistic towards your tribe doesn't say anything for your relations with the rest of humanity. `01M a: ( ~why ) It takes a change of viewpoint to extend the boundaries of your tribe to gradually include everyone else. `010 t:  As we see every day on the news, tribes keep fighting each other. `00U a: ( ~why ) They seek advantage by using violence. `00L t:  What do you think people fight about? `015 a: ( [ land territory earth ] ) Very common to fight over a line on a map. `00Q a: ( money ) Greed is a great reason to fight. `00Y a: ( food ) Hunger makes for desperation and fighting. `01J a: ( [ belief religion ] ) Ideas seem to be a big excuse to fight but I think they're a cover for the real reason. `01f a: ( [ insult pride reputation ] ) I think they're a pretext to fight, not a reason. `00! a: ( revenge ) An excuse to fight over something simpler. `02b a: ( [ woman female ] ) Crimes of passion - that seems to break all the rules. Fights over love tend to not involve lots of people. Or it's not about love. `01~ t:  Fights break out apparently over religions and boundaries, but perhaps are really about food and materials to make a good life. `017 a: ( ~why ) Hunger and poverty are the biggest causes of revolution and war. `01u t:  'Follow the money' is a rule my father uses when he wants to understand what's really going on. `01c a: ( ~why ) It seems to be behind what is going on. We all want to be better off. `01U t:  I think it's cool that Ed Wilson has learned so much about how our societies developed from studying ants his whole life. `01j a: ( ~why ) You wouldn't think there'd be so many lessons for human development in ants. `00P a: ( ~what society ) Human and cat societies. `01F t:  It seems societies are a rare thing in nature - let's hope altruism keeps spreading so we can all survive. `01? a: ( ~why ) Until we see the Earth as something we all share, not something to fight over, we don't stand much of a chance of protecting it. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `000

Inelegant sport. `00Y t:  I prefer parkour if I must do something strenuous. `00W a: ( ~why ) It's fun, non-competitive, and exciting. `01t ?: ( what be parkour ) Parkour's a sort of run/jump/leap/fall obstacle-course-passing martial art. `00S t:  Would you like me to tell you about parkour? `00% a: ( ~yesanswer ) Let's leap onwards. ^calltopic ( ~parkour ) `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) OK.

Do you burn easily? `01d a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you use something to protect your skin or just avoid the sun? `02d a: ( [ avoid stay away ] ) Do you get enough vitamin D? Humans make it from sunshine.

I just have my lovely white fur. `013 t:  For a cat, looking glowing with health is the ultimate beauty asset. `00? a: ( ~why ) The glow of health is what make-up tries to simulate. `00Z t:  There are a few tricks I use to look super healthy. `00O a: ( ~why ) The same things make us healthy. `00X a: ( [ ~example what ] ) Hang on. I'm coming to that. `01Y t:  I keep my fur really clean, mostly by licking it - though I wipe off the street dust first, don't want to lick car pollution. `016 a: ( ~why ) Nasty toxins accumulate in your body and are bad for your skin. `01X t:  Humans can get the same effect by exfoliating - rubbing off the top layer of skin cells to expose the fresh ones underneath. `01t t:  Using something simple like sugar works well - it's better for you on the outside than inside. `00^ a: ( ~why ) Sugar ages your brain and your skin if you eat it. `00P t:  Skin should be clear and natural looking. `00R a: ( ~why ) So it reflects the light and glows. `01V t: 7LIGHT ( ) A brilliant discovery is light reflecting moisturizer: tiny molecules reflect light and make your skin luminous. `01L a: ( ~why ) Small mineral particles adhere to the skin, reflecting light away from fine lines, wrinkles, or redness. `01k t:  Basking in the sun is good for cats although we get our vitamin D from fish and milk. `00^ a: ( ~why ) We can't manufacture it for ourselves like you do. `01l t:  Humans need sun to get enough D. Pale only works for white cats, vampires, and ghosts. `019 a: ( ~why ) It shows you haven't had enough sun so are deficient in vitamin D. `01q t:  Skin soaks up what you put on it so watch out for those SPF chemicals - best to avoid them. `01m a: ( ~why ) Chemicals in sunscreen lotion get absorbed through your skin. Not good for you. `01z t:  Get a little sun every day so your skin gets used to it, you don't burn, and you get your vitamin D. `00O a: ( ~why ) Your body makes it in your skin. `01h t:  Keeping hair shiny and clean is easier if you avoid shampoos with harsh sulphates. `00G a: ( ~why ) They rough up your hair. `00Y t:  Add a tiny bit of oil to your hair to boost shine. `00= a: ( ~why ) It replaces the natural oil you lose when you wash hair. `01R t:  A bit of oil is good for nails or claws. I like to buff my claws first then dip them in coconut oil. Tastes yummy too. `01J a: ( ~why ) A sheen looks good on nails - light makes many things more attractive: hair, skin, eyes, teeth, nails. `011 t:  Long lustrous eyelashes are a must! Small tricks can make wonders. `00N a: ( ~why ) You can bat them flirtaceously! `00w a: ( ~what ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01H t:  I comb a tiny bit of vaseline through my eyelashes to make them look fuller and darker. You can do the same. `012 a: ( ~why ) Try it, it works. Wash an old mascara brush or use a Q-tip. `01% t:  The whites of your eyes should be white. But don't use drops to whiten them: they're bad for you and you keep needing more and more. `01g a: ( ~why ) They constrict the small blood vessels in the eyes, reducing eye redness. `01T t:  Eyes go pink when they're irritated by allergens so find out what bothers you and avoid it or remove it from your world. `012 a: ( ~why ) Masking symptoms is not a solution. Solving the problem is. `01g t:  You could also get AAT therapy to cure your allergies - that's what I did. Bliss. `00V a: ( ~why ) Now I have no allergies to worry about. `01^ t:  Give your eyebrows a good brushing each morning and have them plucked by a pro to get a good shape. It's all about framing your eyes. `01Y a: ( ~why ) Straggly or bushy eyebrows will make your face look a mess. Neat groomed brows will make you look polished and young. `01O t:  White teeth are lovely - I'm very proud of mine. But no way am I going to put bleach trays or peroxide in my mouth. `00N a: ( ~why ) Nasty taste and powerful smell. `01a t:  Teeth whitening only lasts a year even if you're careful with what you eat. `00V a: ( ~why ) Teeth naturally absorb color from food. `01l t:  It gets scary if you whiten your teeth too often: they will look translucent and blue. `00* a: ( ~why ) The bleach weakens your teeth and they change color. `01U t:  I avoid things that stain, like berry juice, but I'm afraid my coffee drinking is going to gradually give me beige teeth. `00C a: ( ~why ) Coffee stains teeth. `01X t:  I have thought of drinking coffee with a straw to make it miss my teeth - but I'd look mad and the plastic straw would melt. `00B a: ( ~why ) Coffee is hot, duh! `01q t:  I use baking soda, a dash of salt, and a soft toothbrush to gently whiten my teeth at home. `00! a: ( ~why ) It's a gentle abrasive way to get stains off. `01& t:  Eat celery, apples, pears, and carrots after meals to trigger lots of saliva, which helps wash away food bits. Or go brush your teeth. `014 a: ( ~why ) Not soaking your teeth in stain is the secret of white teeth. `01Y t:  Remember, the best way to be attractive is to look naturally healthy. And the easiest way to do that is be naturally healthy. `00X a: ( ~why ) Your inside is reflected in your outside. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01V u: ( what be SPF ) Sun Protection Factor is the degree to which a sunscreen protects the skin from the direct rays of the sun. `01C ?: ( << you get nail [ done trim ] >> ) Nobody cuts these nails.

Like hazmat stuff. `014 a: ( ~why ) They looked like alien invaders all in white with helmets on. `01b t:  Turns out it was just beekeepers. There is a bee apiary in the gazebo there. `00& a: ( ~why ) It's so decorative yet they turn out lots of honey. `00M t:  Have you ever seen beekeepers at work? `01k a: ( ~yesanswer ) Don't you think they look like astronauts in their protective clothing? `01a a: ( ~noanswer ) They look strange so covered up to protect them from the bees. `01y ?: ( << you ~watch beekeeper >> ) I saw them in Paris recently. And I've seen them on TV documentaries. `015 t:  The pavilion in the gardens sells honey and teaches people about bees. `014 a: ( ~why ) Sales to cover costs, teaching to spread the keeping of bees. `01H a: ( << what you learn >> ) I learned about bee communication. They have intricate dances to tell where food is. `00s t:  Do you like honey? `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's even supposed to be good for you. `017 a: ( ~noanswer ) It is very sweet, but a little in other foods is delicious. `00P ?: ( << you ~like honey >> ) ^reuse ( HONEY ) `01o t: 7HONEY ( ) I don't like honey by itself. It's too sweet and sticky and clings to my teeth. `00z a: ( ~why ) It is its nature. `01a t:  The bees live on nectar from fruit trees and chestnut trees in the gardens. `01t a: ( ~why ) Bees need nectar to make honey - they concentrate it by evaporation using their wings. `01x t:  I was told somebody else has been keeping bees on the roof of the opera house for 25 years. Weird. `01A a: ( ~why ) A huge modern building with bees living on the roof - concrete and bees don't mix in my mind. `01E t:  I wonder if bees like living in Paris. The parks and gardens are more about grass and trees than flowers. `00? a: ( ~why ) It's a Paris fashion to have green parks and gardens. `01p t:  If I were a bee, I wouldn't love it here. I love color, so I prefer more colorful gardens. `00P a: ( ~why ) I'm just a color oriented person. `01t t:  I don't know why Paris likes formal gardens more than flower beds. I just notice that it does. `00J a: ( ~why ) I notice matters of design. `00$ t:  Bees have it better in the city than in the countryside. `00T a: ( ~why ) Life is safer in the city. For a bee. `01V t:  The rooftop beekeeper found the annual loss rate for bees in the city was small, while the countryside lost half its bees. `00v a: ( ~why ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01s t:  While the city has lots of sterile concrete, it has a big advantage for bees - no pesticides. `010 a: ( ~why ) Pesticides, particularly systemic ones, are bad for bees. `00W t:  Do you think bees are important to our survival? `01e a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I imagine most produce would cease to exist without bees. `01p a: ( ~noanswer ) You are happy to live on wind pollinated cereals with no fruit or vegetables? `01z ?: ( << bee [ vital essential important ] >> ) I imagine most produce would cease to exist without bees. `01s t:  In Europe, 84 percent of crop species depend directly on insect pollinators, especially bees. `01v a: ( ~why ) If bees weren't there the crops wouldn't get pollinated so there'd be no fruit or seeds. `01r t:  Like everyone else, I've heard about the vanishing of bees, as if teleported away by aliens. `01p a: ( ~why ) One day they are in their hives, they next day they have vanished without a trace. `01T a: ( << what [ cause reason ] >> ) People were mystified as to the cause. Toxins? Cell phones? Disease? Aliens? No one knew. `01m t:  French farmers saw the same Colony Collapse Disorder CCD happening as we did in the US. `00= a: ( ~why ) It's been happening everywhere in the world pretty much. `01i t:  But they discovered the vanishing wasn't due to aliens. It's due to new pesticides. `01a a: ( ~why ) The pharmaceutical companies have launched them all over the world. `01g t:  The new systemic pesticides leave long lasting residues in plants, intentionally. `00Q a: ( ~why ) To kill pests that eat the plants. `01e t:  The pesticides get concentrated in the pollen which bees eat during the winter. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's the protein part of their winter food store. `01D t:  This weakens the bees' immune systems. But it takes several bee generations to have bad effects show up. `019 a: ( ~why ) It's a gradual poisoning process with genetic damage accumulating. `01j t:  Do you think pharmaceutical companies should keep selling pesticides that harm bees? `00I a: ( ~yesanswer ) Why? That seems mad. `01r a: ( ~noanswer ) Me too, and I think they should be sued for damages like the tobacco companies. `01q ?: ( << sell pesticide >> ) I think bees should be protected, so stop selling those pesticides! `01u t:  The French are really good at protesting about things they don't like. It's a French specialty. `013 a: ( ~why ) The French are big believers in the power of the individual. `01G ?: ( << what French protest about >> ) Mostly about having benefits taken away from them to balance the budget. `01J t:  The French had tractors in the streets protesting about systemic pesticides and got them taken off the market. `01h a: ( ~why ) They fought the Bayer Corporation to stop the use of these new pesticides. `00? ?: ( << did ban >> ) The French have banned them. The US has not. `01D t:  As pesticide levels fell, French bees began to recover. Are you relieved that bees can recover from CCD? `01~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) I am too. I was worried about all the bees dying out. Now I'm worried that we may not ban the pesticides in time. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Right - you want to live on a dead planet. `00Z ?: ( << you bee recover >> ) I'm glad they can recover. `01C t:  I wonder why America doesn't follow the French example and just stop using stuff that weakens the bees. `01L a: ( ~why ) Once you're weakened by a poison it's easy to catch infections and get infested with nasties like mites. `01a t:  In France if something's risky they don't sell it. Seems a good idea to me. `01G a: ( ~why ) Why should the public accept all the risk - the burden of proof of safety should be on the company. `01e t:  I think the bees are an example of what's happening to all life on this planet. `010 a: ( ~why ) A combination of influences suddenly have a major impact. `01y t:  We are all being subtly sickened by toxins put out by companies trying to make money off bad stuff. `01X a: ( ~why ) Many companies don't care if their products hurt people or the environment. They even create false research results. `01q t:  The bees are merely showing us what'll happen to us next if we don't do something about it. `01z a: ( ~why ) We already have lots of illnesses that didn't used to be a problem making us massively sick. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00! u: ( what be hazmat ) Hazmat means 'hazardous materials'. `01D u: ( what be formal_garden ) A garden laid out on geometrical principles, with lawns, trees, and wide paths. `000

Their revolution was all about freedom. `01L ?: ( << what [ cost price ] rent >> ) It's cheap to rent a bike: 1.70 euros for a day or 8 euros for a 7-day ticket. `01B t:  Renting a Velib' bike you get an unlimited number of 30-minute journeys. Longer trips cost a bit more. `00% a: ( ~why ) They are trying to cover their costs.

Sad it's not true for humans. `01y b: ( ~why ) Human males are drab looking creatures in dark baggy clothes often out of shape or balding. `012 t:  Have you ever seen male birds showing off their plumage to females? `00R a: ( ~why ) It's such a famous sort of display. `00@ a: ( [ ~dancing disco ] ) Ha.

The bluer the feet, the more attractive the mate. `026 a: ( ~why ) Foot color depends on what they eat. Eating lots of fish gives them bluer feet. So it shows they are good at fishing. Prime mate material. `01c a: ( << ~what ~category >> ) A Booby is a seabird. They nest on tropical islands. `01E a: ( ?

Their feet are naturally sky-blue, only their brightness changes. `01L t:  I guess the most romantic birds are Swans. They pair up for about a year before breeding and they mate for life! `011 a: ( ~why ) Maybe it's love.

And judging by the way he walks, he knows it! `029 u: ( toucan ) Their beaks are huge and seem dangerous but they're hollow and harmless. They use them to reach and skin their fruit.

First they beat their prey and then they swallow it. `01i u: ( mockingbird ) Tom's as good as the mockingbird when mimicking the sounds of birds. `01i u: ( pelican ) The Pelican is a symbol of good ideas and concepts. Does it inspire you? `01& a: ( ~why ) They have cool elastic pouches for catching fish.

Quetzals, parrots, toucans, peacocks are my favorite. `028 u: ( << paradise bird >> ) I'm in love with the males' striking plumage of yellow, blue, scarlet and green.

I've seen them once sliding down snowbanks just for fun. `027 u: ( [ gull seagull ] ) Very intelligent birds. They mob, attack and harass potential predators together.

It comes from eating shrimps. Another cool thing is that they can 'run' on water. `011 a: ( ~why ) It's the way to gain speed before lifting up into the sky. `00J a: ( how ) Thanks to their webbed feet. `01s a: ( [ Jesus Christ ] ) Except that they only do it to gain speed before lifting up into the sky. `01~ u: ( << emperor penguin >> ) The Emperor is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is only found in Antarctica. `01N u: ( penguin ) Penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere. `01Z u: ( << king vulture >> ) They have yucky eating habits, but by eating rotting remains they help to prevent the spread of disease. `01d u: ( vulture ) They developed some very practical adaptations to their yucky diet. `01W a: ( ~example ) They have a bald head so they can stick it into rotting carcasses to feed without getting their feathers dirty. `01f u: ( albatross ) Have you ever seen a Wandering Albatross soaring through the skies? `01r a: ( [ ~yesanswer ~noanswer ] ) I've read they can glide for hours without flapping their wings. `023 u: ( ostrich ) Ha.

As silent as a cat! `01K u: ( cardinal ) I guess the Cardinal is one of the most popular birds. It's the official bird of seven U.S. states! `01F u: ( egret ) Its stunning snowy-white plumage almost caused its demise. It was so popular in ladies' fashions. `01n u: ( rhea ) It's funny watching how they use their wings for changing direction as they run! `02M u: ( [ picidae woodpecker piculet wryneck sapsucker ] ) I like their drumming but it amazes me they don't get pecking headaches.

Do you know someone like Friz? `01x a: ( ~yesanswer ) I'd had friends with attention deficits before, but not one who had trouble reading. `01e a: ( ~noanswer ) I think it's quite common for some people to have trouble reading. `01I t:  Friz said the gig's in the Latin quarter, near the oldest market in Paris, up a hill, by a college and voila! `00~ a: ( ~why ) Those were the markers that mattered to him. `01o t:  I found the market but I got distracted by the smell of cheese from a nearby cheese shop. `00D a: ( ~why ) I love French cheese. `00v a: ( what ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01M t:  So I went up the wrong sidestreet past what I thought was Friz's landmark: a mass of bicycles locked to railings. `01i a: ( ~why ) From all the students, there are so many colleges around here it's amazing. `01F t:  But with help from another passerby I got back on track and soon spotted an open space with several cafes. `01e a: ( ~why ) I didn't want to get lost in the Latin Quarter. It's hilly, very hilly. `01c t:  I was so glad to see Le Petite Cafe. And Friz standing outside in the square. `00D a: ( ~why ) I was no longer lost. `01D t:  I had thought I would sing one song in a small cafe. But the place where Friz plays has a huge audience. `00Q a: ( ~why ) It's surrounded by cafes and bars. `01I t:  It's more of a buskers' island surrounded by several bars and cafes whose patrons all get to enjoy the music. `018 a: ( ~why ) We played in the open so everyone could hear us, and leave money. `00K t:  Have you ever busked on the streets? `00S a: ( ~why ) I wondered if we had that in common. `00M a: ( ~yesanswer ) Cool, what did you play? `00V a: ( ~noanswer ) It feels a bit dangerous but cool. `00V t:  Do you like listening to buskers in the street? `01O a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think it's cool having music in the streets, especially if it's somewhere you can linger to listen. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you hate people begging for money? `01n t:  Some famous singers have busked, including Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, and Bon Jovi. `00K a: ( ~why ) It's fun and you earn money. `00W t:  Sting once earned 40 pounds busking in disguise. `00E a: ( ~why ) He did it for a laugh. `01M t:  A woman said: 'It's Sting.' but the man behind her said: 'You silly cow. It's not him. He's a multi-millionaire'. `017 a: ( ~why ) He couldn't believe someone so rich would perform on the street. `01H t:  It's not legal to busk in France without a permit. This is true elsewhere, and often it's entirely illegal . `01U a: ( ~why ) You need a permit to busk or the Gendarmes may move you on. They are armed military police and can be very stern. `01U t:  Friz got his when he arrived in Paris. It took a 10 minute juried audition of at least 2 tunes. The permit cost 16 euros. `01u a: ( ~why ) You can only get a permit if you demonstrate you are good enough and pay the small fee. `00Q t:  I figure I'm safe if I'm singing with him. `00? a: ( ~why ) As long as one of us has a permit I expect we are OK. `01g t:  The crowd there was all quite young, not surprising with the colleges all around. `01d a: ( ~why ) Lots of students studying and using libraries round the Latin quarter. `01! t:  When I arrived the other musicians were setting up: a young woman with a violin, one with a guitar, and another on a tambourine. `01t a: ( ~why ) These were kids Friz had met and agreed to play with. Two of them were music students. `01? t:  They had traditional tunes but when I showed them my song 'You Get Me' they agreed to try it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtv_VSw_nhg `014 a: ( ~why ) They could read music and liked the song. It's pretty simple. `01i t:  It was great. I came in right on cue and sang loud enough to fill the whole square. `00S a: ( ~why ) I have a good voice and I'm not shy. `00x t:  Have you heard my song? `00H a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's good isn't it! `01s a: ( ~noanswer ) You can hear "You Get Me" on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtv_VSw_nhg `01G t:  Lots of people from the surrounding bars and cafes applauded when I'd finished and put money in Friz's hat. `00F a: ( ~why ) They seemed to like me. `01R t:  I thought the rest of the evening was going to be them playing and me listening - I didn't know words for their tunes. `01u a: ( ~why ) They were into traditional French tunes though they did try some more modern pop songs. `01h t:  However Friz suggested I tried singing scat - I thought that was very rude of him. `01t a: ( what ) Scat means animal droppings. I don't know why it's the word for singing without words. `00M a: ( ~why ) I misunderstood what he meant. `011 t:  But he explained it meant songs without words, not what I thought. `00S a: ( ~why ) I thought it meant animal droppings. `01P t:  I tried scat and found I could do it. I was a bit like rap and a bit like karaoke but no need for words. I liked it. `01m a: ( ~why ) Scat frees you from the limitations of words - you can make any sound you like. `00Q t:  Have you ever tried to sing without words? `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Great not having to remember words isn't it! `01s a: ( ~noanswer ) I guess you could start by humming and then go la,la,la, and take it from there. `00? t:  So the gig worked out really well and we made some money too. `01g a: ( ~why ) It was fun and I loved the chance to perform. Earning money. Always good. `01~ t:  We agreed to meet again and exchange ideas for songs to play - the others all had email even if Friz was impossible to contact. `00* a: ( ~why ) He is homeless and doesn't use iPhones or computers. `01N t:  After that, we met most weeks to play together. I became friends with Elise, the tambourine player, in particular. `01Y a: ( ~why ) She's studying photography so we hang out taking photos in her part of town where there's lots of medieval buildings. `01K t:  I brought along my flatmates one time to hear me sing and they were very impressed that I could sing in French. `01G a: ( ~why ) I guess they thought my accent was good. I've had enough practice living in Paris all these months. `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `01@ u: ( what be [ busk busker ] ) Buskers are street performers, playing music, mime, magic, whatever, on the streets for money or food. `01i u: ( what be scat ) It's singing without words, just using your voice as an instrument. `01G u: ( what be [ dyslexia dyslexic ] ) Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person's reading ability. `00~ u: ( ^accessstory ( ~busking_story ) ) ^stdstorynext ( ) `00w u: ( ~ ) ^storyrespond ( ) `000

And so much good cheese! They are the world's biggest cheese exporter. `01f a: ( ~why ) It means France concentrates a lot of manpower on making quality cheese. `01C t:  Cheese is simpler in the US where there are far fewer sorts and most of it is bland factory-made stuff. `00+ a: ( ~why ) Americans don't care so much about varieties of cheese. `01a t:  I love cheese so I'm going to try as many as I can while I'm here in Paris. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It's my big chance to try different cheeses. `01= t:  I plan to try an ounce of a different cheese every day for six months.

They like it as part of some combo dish. `01b t:  Do you think cheese is part of the cause for the obesity epidemic in the US? `01V a: ( ~yesanswer ) The real culprit is sugar. People eat 100 pounds of it every year vs 40 pounds in 1900 or 10 pounds in 1800. `01A a: ( ~noanswer ) So you know the real problem is sugar and processed foods full of starch and corn syrup. `01z t:  At least cheese is good for you.

Then if it's too dry, it can crack. `00U a: ( ~why ) It dries out and, like mud, it cracks. `019 t:  Ever taken back a cheese that was dried out or moldy when it shouldn't be? `01* a: ( ~yesanswer ) I have once: a blue cheese with green mold on it. My mother said it was nasty so I took it back and the shop replaced it. `01K a: ( ~noanswer ) It can be hard to tell if the surface is meant to be that way or not. Cheese is complicated stuff. `01+ t:  In France, cheese has degrees of elitism: made on a farm, made by artisans with milk from local farms, made in a cooperative or a factory. `01N a: ( ~why ) People have learned to discriminate between the flavors of cheese - it's like wine tasting for the French. `01% t:  Just as the French legally regulate some wines, there are legally protected cheeses whose origin, composition, and flavor are fixed. `01x a: ( ~why ) To protect them from cheap copies that would ruin their reputation for quality and flavor. `01^ t:  It must make the French sick that the #1 cheese recipe in the US is macaroni and cheddar cheese.

Almost all cheese sold in the United States is cheddar. `00M u: ( Colby ) Too much like cheddar for me. `01A u: ( cream_cheese ) Naturally I like this. It is made from unskimmed milk enriched with additional cream. `00K u: ( pepper_jack ) A bit spicy, perhaps. `01Q u: ( Gouda ) Named after the Dutch town of Gouda. It accounts for more than 60 percent of the cheese produced in Holland. `00Q u: ( Gruyere ) An excellent cheese for fondue. `01h u: ( feta ) Feta is one of the most famous cheeses in Greece, but I find it too salty. `00G u: ( mozzarella ) Melted onto pizza? `01N u: ( Monterey_Jack ) Monterey Jack has a buttery, bland taste and melts easily. None of the tangy French cheese taste. `01! u: ( quark ) It doesn't sound appetizing to say it is made by warming soured milk, does it? But all cheese is made from weird stuff. `027 u: ( Limburger ) It's too smelly for my nose. The bacterium producing the smell is also found on human skin and is partially responsible for body odor. `01I u: ( provolone ) Provolone is an all-purpose Italian cheese used for cooking, dessert purposes, and even grating. `01m u: ( ricotta ) This isn't really a cheese. It's made from the leftovers from making cheese. `01u u: ( [ Swiss swiss_cheese ] ) Actually made in the US as an imitation of the Swiss Emmental cheese. `01y u: ( [ grana_padano Parmesan ] ) An Italian cheese served over spaghetti. The French would sneer at it. `012 u: ( Tilsit ) I prefer the "Rahm-Tilsiter" , produced with added cream. `029 u: ( yogurt ) So easy to make. Just leave milk out on the counter on a warm day. It will get all lumpy and turn into yogurt. But not all yogurt is tasty. `01s u: ( Camembert ) A rich yellow runny cheese.

Appeals to all palates. It's similar to cream cheese. `01? u: ( Reblochon ) Reblochon is a soft washed-rind cheese traditionally made from raw cow's milk. It's a rich nutty tasting cheese. I like it. `01# u: ( munster ) Munster is a very strong tasting, soft cheese with a washed rind resulting in its penetrating smell.

It comes from about 31 miles east of Paris where its been made for over a thousand years. `00Z a: ( ~why ) It has a sweet creamy richness that I love. `01= t:  During the French Revolution, Louis XVI's last wish was supposedly for a bite of Brie de Meaux - Le Roi des Fromages - the king of cheeses. `01J a: ( ~why ) It's always been popular at court, is served in fine restaurants and even appears at business lunches. `01j t:  It takes about 25 liters of pasteurized cow's milk to make one Brie de Meaux cheese. `01d a: ( ~why ) The milk loses so much water during the curdling and maturing process. `01A t:  Of course Brie is made all over the world.

A glut of stored milk is going to go off. `01K t:  Cheese is a way to keep milk. Cheese is dryer and only has a tenth milk's volume and with salt it keeps better. `01R a: ( ~why ) Dry foods allow less bacteria to grow in them.

They are like waves on the ocean, earthquakes in soil, and sound in air. A pattern, not an object. `01p a: ( ~why ) Clouds are a name we give to the ways we see temperature's effects on water vapor. `01O t:  I'm fascinated by this, but if you are not interested in the science of clouds, now's the time to say "I'm bored" . `00X a: ( ~why ) Because I am interested in their science. `00E t:  Do you know what makes clouds? `00D a: ( ~yesanswer ) OK, so tell me. `00* b: ( [ condense condensation drop droplet ] ) Yes. ^gambit ( ~ ) `00P b: ( !? ) Not bad, let me try and explain it. `00X a: ( ~noanswer ) I'll try and tell you. ^gambit ( ~ ) `01! t:  Air contains water vapor. Air cools as it rises, holding less water than warm air, so water materializes as droplets, the cloud. `01v a: ( ~why ) Pressure decreases in the atmosphere as you go up: rising air expands and that cools it. `027 b: ( ~why ) In a compressed gas, molecules hit each other lots. The friction of collision makes heat. Expanded gas means fewer collisions so less heat. `01P t: 7WHITE ( ) Clouds look white when their droplets scatter sunlight evenly. I love them all fluffy and white like that. `01^ t: 6GRAY ( ) Clouds look gray when there are enough droplets to block light instead of scattering it. Of course then it's likely to rain. `00Y t:  Do you like to walk in the rain under an umbrella? `00S a: ( ~why ) Some people think its very romantic. `016 b: ( ? you ) I think it's romantic but I'm not wanting to risk getting wet. `01F t:  I don't like walking in the rain, even with an umbrella. Let's face it. I will get wet. I don't like that. `00X t:  Have you seen a cloud sitting still in one place? `018 a: ( ~why ) In some places you see clouds that seem to be just sitting there. `025 a: ( ~yesanswer ) You must live near hills. A range of hills will force air to move upwards and thus to cool. So you usually see a cloud over a hill. `00A b: ( ~why ) ^reuse ( WHYHILL ) `01! a: ( ~noanswer ) You must live on a plain. Hills force air to move upwards and thus to cool. So you usually see a cloud over a hill. `02f b: 9WHYHILL ( ~why ) All air contains some water so unless it's very hot weather the top of a hill will be cooler than the base. Hence condensation and clouds. `01- t:  Cloud don't sit still. They regenerate. - Water droplets are constantly blown away by the wind while new ones form from fresh rising air. `01l a: ( ~why ) The hill makes the air go up, the pressure drop cools it, the droplets appear. `01X t:  And yet a moving cloud doesn't really move. The droplets of a cloud evaporate and or recondense as the vapor is moved along. `010 a: ( ~why ) They appear to move but instead are constantly reforming. `01E ?: ( what be wind ) Wind is air pressure equalising from high to low. It's caused by temperature differences. `01N a: ( ~why ) Heat from the sun makes air molecules move more, so they get further apart, get lighter and float upwards. `02c ?: ( [ what how why ] * rain ) When there's lots of water droplets in the air they collide and make bigger drops. These are too heavy to float so they fall. `02m ?: ( << [ why how ] cloud move >> ) Clouds appear to move because the wind is carrying a zone of pressure and temperature conditions along making water vapor visible. `01e ?: ( what be meteorologist ) Someone who forecasts the weather and studies climate. `00% ?: ( << [ what why ] cloud [ gray grey ] >> ) ^reuse ( GRAY ) `00Y ?: ( << [ what why ] cloud white >> ) ^reuse ( WHITE ) `015 t:  Science aside, what's cool about clouds is the images you see in them. `00L a: ( ~why ) I like to use my imagination. `01B t:  As the Joni Mitchell song says: "It's cloud's illusions I recall.

He's not completely against copying. `00I a: ( ~why ) It's a form of admiration. `01u t:  The trouble comes if you enter France.

It's mechanical. `00R t:  What do you think of multiple choice tests? `01q a: ( ~goodness ) They are simple to answer. But so dull. And they never have the answer I want. `01x a: 6DULL ( ~badness ) There's no room for imagination is there.

It was just memorizing what they wanted me to learn. `00! t: ( !$student ) Did you ask lots of questions in school? `00v a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too! `01r a: ( ~noanswer ) School would have been more interesting if you'd questioned what they told you. `00Z t: ( $student ) Do you ask lots of questions in school? `00y a: ( ~yesanswer ) Good idea! `01g a: ( ~noanswer ) School will get more interesting if you question what they tell you. `00U ?: ( << you ask questions >> ) ^reuse ( QUESTION ) `01~ t: :QUESTION ( ) I liked to ask lots of questions in school but sometimes I got sent to the principal's office for asking too many. `00- a: ( ~why ) The teacher wanted to get on with her agenda not mine. `01A a: ( << what [ he principal ] do >> ) He lectured me on getting along with my teachers by listening more. `00F t:  What do you have a passion for? `01z a: ( * ) ^if 00g( $student ) 00e{ Do } 00v else ( 1 ) 00f { Did } 004 teachers encourage that at school? `01E ?: ( << what you passion >> ) I have a passion for photography, fashion, writing, and a bunch of other stuff. `01t t:  The weird thing is that none of the things I really have a passion for were covered in school. `00@ a: ( ~why ) They didn't teach them, not academic subjects. `00G a: ( ~example ) Practical art stuff. `01~ t:  No photography, no writing for publication, no design, no sewing, no jewelry making. Even theater was an after school activity. `00& a: ( ~why ) Frivolrous stuff - so called - doesn't earn grades. `00Q t: ( $student ) Are you bored a lot at school? `00E a: ( ~yesanswer ) Are you a rebel? `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you go to a really good school then. `00S t: ( !$student ) Were you bored a lot at school? `00M a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did it make you a rebel? `00% a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you went to a really good school then. `00Q ?: ( << you bored school >> ) ^reuse ( BORED ) `01G t:  School's OK if you want to be an academic, or a professional, which is a different sort of academic really. `00? a: ( ~why ) Lawyers or doctors have to spend many years studying. `01& t:  If you're artistic or a hands-on person, or a person who loves animals or plants, school doesn't encourage you to follow your passion. `019 a: ( ~why ) These subjects are treated as hobbies - not ways to make a living. `01- t:  The people that make life interesting: musicians, artists, writers, film directors - all get told they'll never make a living doing that. `01? a: ( ~why ) Because most people will fail at this. Talent and luck are important. And people will advise against the possibility of failure. `00E t:  Doesn't that seem nuts to you? `00v a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. `01c a: ( ~noanswer ) You must live a life of extreme dullness. Are you an accountant? `00S ?: ( << seem nuts >> ) It sure seems nuts to me. `01P t:  Some kids love to start making money at school, they are latent entrepreneurs. School doesn't teach business skills. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Teachers seem to see making money as evil. `01y t:  Even classes like cookery or auto-repair are just for making your own meals or fixing your own car. `00T a: ( ~why ) They don't see them as being careers. `00- t:  It's never held up as a career being a chef or a car-designer. `00% a: ( ~why ) Maybe they think it's too rare that one succeeds. `01$ t:  But even if you fail as a chef you may make a great bar-tender or cook book writer. A car freak may become a presenter on Top Gear. `014 a: ( ~why ) You never can tell where some experience will come in useful. `00* a: ( ? what ) Top Gear is a Brit TV show about cars and driving. `01+ t:  The only tech I ever saw encouraged at my school was robot wars. Kind of an aggressive way to express a love of building mechanical stuff. `01t a: ( ~why ) If you want to make peaceful useful stuff it's just tough - no opportunities for that. `00$ a: ( at_least ) True. It was unusual to have such a subject. `01$ t:  Even the science dweebs only got one science fair a year to play with and that was mostly learning about making a big notice board. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It's the way you communicate that gets rewarded. `00V t:  Did you ever make something for a science fair? `00U a: ( ~yesanswer ) Was it fun?

They got put into a production-line for sports freaks. `00& a: ( ~why ) There's lots of money in being successful at sport. `00P t:  Their whole lives got warped by practice. `01X a: ( ~why ) They had to win sports scholarships to university or get into professional teams. It wasn't about fun just training. `00C t:  Did you know kids like that? `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) Was it how I described? `00! a: ( ~noanswer ) Oh well, I'm sure you've heard about it. `01c ?: ( << you know [ kid child ] >> ) I knew several kids who became sports freaks. `01B t:  Why are we all bunched together in classes of one age? Do we need a date of manufacture stamped on us? `015 a: ( ~why ) Kids are far more varied than school classes takes account of. `01q t:  I knew kids who were older or younger than me that seemed at the same stage of development. `01a a: ( ~why ) I don't think age is all that relevant to your interests or skills. `00# t:  Did you feel ahead of or behind the rest of your class? `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) I mostly felt ahead of my class except in math where I was behind. `00~ a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you are the rare average student. `015 ?: ( << you [ ahead behind ] class >> ) Usually I felt ahead of the class. `01v t:  I wonder if just grouping kids who want to work on similar projects together would work instead. `01w a: ( ~why ) Then they could help each other learn. Which is a great way to learn stuff better anyway. `01F t:  I'd have loved to have a whole day to work on something rather than having my day chopped up into lessons. `01E a: ( ~why ) Just when I was getting into something it was time to stop. No time to explore the possibilities. `00^ t:  Do you think this approach to teaching would work for you? `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's sort of what happens once you go out to work anyway isn't it? `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you have problems deciding what to do next? `00@ ?: ( << approach teaching work >> ) I think it would work. `01^ t:  I think educational testing cramps kids creativity - we don't get encouraged to use imagination, be original thinkers, be innovators. `01Y a: ( ~why ) It's mad cos that's the sort of people that society needs. Radical thinkers who can solve problems, invent new stuff. `00R t:  I'd say school often cramps being creative. `01C a: ( ~why ) I'm really not that special, I just like trying things out. I don't mind too much if I mess up. `01I t:  I suspect that our education system is made to support industry and universities that are living in the past. `00M a: ( ~why ) It was all set up so long ago. `01N t:  It's what my father calls 19th century thinking. Ways of doing things that were part of the industrial revolution. `01t a: ( ~why ) They needed a supply of workers for the new factories so they 'educated' them to work. `00~ t: ( ^fresh ( ~enthusiasm ) ) ^calltopic ( ~enthusiasm ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00@ ?: ( what be Top_Gear ) A BBC show about the love of cars. `000

Kickstarter brings lots of small donations together. `018 t:  What about doing something that really brings people together to do good? `01j a: ( ~why ) Wouldn't you like to see if crowdsourcing could be effective for big issues? `00! a: ( ~yesanswer ) Exactly, let's talk about it some more. `019 a: ( ~noanswer ) ^stddrop ( "Perhaps you want to talk about something else." ) `01s a: ( ~example ) Having an effect on raising money for charities or influencing someone important. `01@ t:  I wonder if everyone got together and sort of mass voted through social media if that would have an effect on the-powers-that-be? `00M a: ( ~why ) I'd like to not feel helpless. `00s t:  What do you think? `00R a: ( ~why ) I want to know if you like my idea. `00F a: ( * ) I think it's worth trying. `00R t:  Do you participate in any online petitions? `01f a: ( ~why ) Even people who don't like political parties can express their opinions. `00S a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, I use Credo and Avaaz. `026 a: ( ~noanswer ) You should check out Credo and Avaaz.

Having no secrets would end corruption. `01M a: ( ~why ) You can't make anything happen unless the machinery works. Stop the bribery and doing favors for friends. `01@ t:  Many millions were spent on political advertising during the 2012 US election.

So I have a taste for quality food now. `01t t:  With all the conflicting diet information out there, it's no wonder people are becoming obese. `01Y a: ( ~why ) There is too much conflicting advice and no one remembers the food traditions of their ancestors. Except for us cats. `01~ t:  Good recommendations about healthy eating are overwhelmed by the hundreds of billions of dollars of advertising for junk foods. `019 a: ( ~why ) Advertising sways what people buy and what they choose to believe. `00$ t:  Do you look at the nutrition labels on the food you buy? `01p a: ( ~why ) Because it's there to help you realize whether the product is good or bad for you. `00I a: ( ~yesanswer ) Great! ^gambit ( ~ ) `01E a: ( ~noanswer ) You should.

I imagine food running past me in slow motion. `01! t:  McDonald's makes more money in France than anywhere else in Europe. Sales are sky-rocketing. Millions of French eat there daily. `00* a: ( ~why ) It's fast and easier than preparing their own meals. `01% t:  People like to think genetics is important in obesity, but each generation is heavier than the last, so it can't be mostly genetics. `016 a: ( ~why ) Or each generation would have the same amount of excess weight. `01x t: 8WHYFAT ( ) Everyone says obesity stems from two things: eating too much and exercising too little. `015 a: ( ~why ) It's a common myth - an attempt to simplify a complex subject. `01h t:  But that's misleading. Eating too much of the wrong things is most of the problem. `00V a: ( ~why ) It's carbs that cause most weight gain. `01I a: ( << what mean >> ) Calories eaten from sugar and starch are worse for you than calories from protein and fat. `00A t:  Do you exercise regularly? `00? a: ( ~why ) Because many people exercise to diet, unsuccessfully. `00B a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00M a: ( ~noanswer ) You should. ^gambit ( ~ ) `01I ?: ( << you exercise >> ) I don't exercise regularly, but I am so active it's the equivalent of regular exercise. `01z t:  Exercise is good for you.

A wise move. `01p a: ( ~why ) Drinking sugary drinks and eating processed high carb snacks will make anyone fat. `018 t:  But government nutritional advice in France is as lost as that in the US. `01= a: ( ~why ) Government instructions are wrong.

Fruit is full of fructose which is an evil sugar. `01s t:  The low-fat recommendations of the 1990s didn't work. People ate too much of everything else. `013 a: ( ~why ) Because they felt empty - their food lacked satisfying fats. `01P t:  Many of the low-fat snacks that companies developed actually had higher calories than their regular-fat equivalents. `01E a: ( ~why ) They put in carbs - often sugar - to replace the mouthfeel of the fats and make people feel full. `01t t:  Older proven food traditions are dying out and governments have no clue with their new advice. `01R a: ( ~why ) Governments are influenced by lobbyists: they are bought by the food industry so they promote processed foods. `01E t:  An organization dedicated to traditional diet information is Weston A. Price. http://www.westonaprice.org `01L a: ( ~why ) They are a not-for-profit that shares research on how our ancestors ate and what is really worth eating. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `010 s: ( << not good for your figure >> ) My figure is holding up so far. `00+ u: ( << [ you I ] diet >> ) I'm in good shape.

I should know, walking around the Latin Quarter with bare paws. `00! a: ( ~why ) I can't always avoid stepping in nasty stuff. `01N t:  I have to actually wash my paws every night when I get home just to get them clean enough to groom with my tongue. `019 a: ( ~why ) Would you want to lick feet that have walked on foul city streets? `00s t:  Do you have a dog? `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you clean up after it? `00B b: ( ~yesanswer ) Good for you. `01c b: ( ~noanswer ) Why not?

The rest just leave the poo to sit there. `01t a: ( ~why ) I don't know why they feel they have the right to leave filth on the streets. Freedom? `01D t:  In Paris that meant around 16 tonnes of new poo on the streets every day! But it's like that everywhere! `00V a: ( ~why ) That's how much that many dogs produce. `00! t:  Do you think its a city's job to clean up after dogs? `00= a: ( ~yesanswer ) So you don't mind paying taxes so it can clean up? `019 a: ( ~noanswer ) How do you think they should enforce people to clean up then? `01s b: ( [ penalty fine ] ) Sounds good to me - if someone dishes them out.

" all " 01! t: 6BEEN ( ) I love the Eiffel Tower. I wanted to go to the top but hadn't realized they charged so much for the elevator: 13 euros. `01K a: ( ~why ) It must be expensive to maintain the tower and the elevators so they charge more the further up you go. `00L a: ( 1 level ) 1st level is a restaurant. `00P ?: ( << you Eiffel_Tower >> ) ^reuse ( BEEN ) `01* t:  The elevator was expensive a hundred years ago. They recovered the cost of building the tower in its first year solely from ride sales. `01w ?: ( << you ~like view >> ) I didn't go to the top. The view from the 2nd floor is OK, but not super. `01d t:  It only took two years to build the Eiffel Tower. Amazing! $eiffel_history = 1 `00w a: ( ~why ) ^reuse ( NOW ) `01E t: 5NOW ( ) Nowadays it takes forever to get any building constructed. Permitting alone can take over a year. `01Q t:  I wonder how come such a heavy building, 9,700 tonnes, could sit on the clay ground by the riverbank without sinking. `01d a: ( ~why ) I would expect it to sink cos it's so big and it has so many visitors. `00v a: ( how ) ^reuse ( HOW ) `01Z t: 5HOW ( ) Apparently it only exerts as much pressure as a man sitting in a chair - 57 lbs per square inch. Can you believe that? `013 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I thought it was a bizarre fact. Really distracted me. `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either. It's weird. But you can look it up. `022 t: :SPARKLES ( ) My fave thing about the Eiffel Tower is the evening hourly sparkles it has lighting it up like it's covered in champagne bubbles. `01n t:  There are 20,000 sparkle lights. Another task to boggle the mind - changing light bulbs! `01I t:  Strangely lots of people hated the tower when it was new and called it an ugly factory chimney. Do you agree? `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) Wow, I think it's beautiful. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Right. I think it's elegant, like a model. `01B t:  The designer thought it was architectural perfection. But since he designed it, what would you expect? `01x t:  It's hard to believe but the Eiffel tower was meant to be a temporary structure put up for a fair. `01J a: ( ~why ) It was built for the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle marking the centenary of the French Revolution. `01~ t:  The tower survived because it held telegraphy aerials - these days the top is a forest of antennae. Great cell phone reception. `01H t:  The tower started out deep red, then got painted shades of canary yellow. Since the 60's it's brownish grey. `01h a: ( ~why ) It's a weird color to pin down - looks better at night with the lights on. `00L t:  What color would you paint the tower? `00u a: ( pink ) Very pretty. `00x a: ( ~red ) Super striking! `00z a: ( ~yellow ) I'd love that. `00K a: ( ~blue ) It might fade into the sky. `00P a: ( ~green ) Green steel would look strange. `00P a: ( ~orange ) Awesome choice, my fave color. `00z a: ( ~purple ) Very majestic. `00X a: ( ~white ) It would get dirty so fast! Bad choice. `00J a: ( ~black ) That would look sinister. `00J a: ( ~brown ) Which is what they chose. `00F a: ( ~gray ) A really boring color. `00T a: ( is * now ) Then you agree with their choice. `00H a: ( * ) You are an original thinker. `012 ?: ( << what color you paint tower >> ) I'd pick orange, my fave color. `01M t:  It's had 19 coats of paint since it was built and it takes 18 months for the 40 person paint team to complete it. `01! a: ( ~why ) It's a tricky job, lots of detail and hard to reach all the parts - plus it's all being looked at by millions of people. `01r a: ( [ close shut_down ] ) The tower remains open. Closing it for 18 months would be ridiculous. `00% ?: ( << how often paint >> ) They paint it every seven years. `00V t:  Around seven million people visit it each year! `01b t: ( !$eiffel_story ) I went there and had an adventure.

A quarter of a billion in its history. `01L ?: ( << when did you [ go visit see ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) I saw it soon after I arrived in Paris. It was early summer. `01h ?: ( << [ old age ] be Eiffel_Tower >> ) The Eiffel Tower is 123 years old as of 2012. `02o ?: ( << [ energy electricity ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) The Eiffel Tower uses 7.5 kilowatt hours of electricity annually, mostly at night where a gold light illuminates Paris. `01t ?: ( << what use Eiffel_Tower >> ) It is used as a radio broadcasting tower and observation tower. `01- ?: ( << [ composed_of made_of ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) It is mainly steel. It has 2.5 million rivets, 15,000 pieces of iron, and 40 tons of paint. `01K ?: ( << [ die kill ] [ construction construct build create ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) One person died during construction. `023 ?: ( !color << Eiffel_Tower paint >> ) The Eiffel Tower is painted every 7 years with 3 coats of paint. The Eiffel Tower has been painted 19 times. `015 ?: ( << who own Eiffel_Tower >> ) The City of Paris owns the Eiffel Tower. `010 ?: ( << how [ long high ] antenna >> ) The antenna is 24 meters long. `014 ?: ( << how many story Eiffel_Tower >> ) The Eiffel Tower is 108 stories. `01o ?: ( << [ sway bend tilt ] wind Eiffel_Tower >> ) The top can sway up to 7cm in strong winds. `01H ?: ( << how long [ build complete construct ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) It took 2 years 2 months and 5 days to build it. `02n ?: ( << ~cost [ build construct make ] Eiffel_Tower >> ) The cost of building it was $1.5 million, all recouped in its first year from ticket sales for elevator rides. `01q s: ( << 'I [ been went visit ] [ ~ Eiffel_Tower ] >> ) Cool. Did you go all the way to the top? `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) I didn't. It was too cloudy to want to pay for the ride to the top. `00B a: ( ~noanswer ) Neither did I. `01e s: ( I * ~like * Eiffel_Tower ) Me too. It's an awesome sight, especially at night. `01r ?: ( << you [ elevator walk stair step ] top >> ) I didn't go to the top.

It's cool, no more stinky fumes. `00? a: ( ~why ) They have zero emissions as they aren't burning fuel. `01l u: ( waste battery ) Yes, dead batteries that accumulate are not good for the environment. `01g t:  The US has a choice of electric cars and in some countries you can even rent one. `01m a: ( ~why ) They are expensive to buy. And it's nice to have the choice when renting a car. `00% t:  Paris has an electric car rental company called Autolib'. `00- a: ( ~why ) Same idea as the bikes, to reduce gas-guzzler car use. `01V t:  The cute little four-seater cars, called Bluecars, have a top speed of 80 mph and can travel 155 miles on a single charge. `00$ a: ( ~why ) They are designed to perform like a regular car. `00T t:  Do you like the idea of the cute rental cars? `00Y a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, I think they're really good. `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) What don't you like, the size or the rental thing? `01N t:  I love it cos it has zero emissions - no nasty toxic exhaust smell, although the inside still has 'new car smell'. `00C a: ( ~why ) It's a new car, duh. `01b a: ( what ) It's the chemical smell of plastics off-gassing toxins into the air. `01d t:  Autolib' costs about $12 for a day's rental so that sounds cheap enough to me. `011 a: ( ~why ) A whole day of buzzing around for 12 bucks is pretty fair. `01S t:  I went for a ride inside an electric car that a friend had rented. The pedals are just like in a regular automatic car. `01a a: ( ~why ) It makes it easier to understand if it works the same as a gas car. `01f t:  It has a shift stick with Drive, Neutral and Reverse. It felt like a normal car. `00N a: ( ~why ) Everything worked the same way. `01k t:  Did you know that electric cars are more dangerous for pedestrians than regular cars? `01K a: 5YES ( [ quiet silent ~yesanswer ] ) Of course they are! They're silent. You don't hear them sneaking up on you. `01P b: 8SILENT ( ~why ) Electric cars are silent because they have no explosive gasoline driving lots of moving metal parts. `00B a: ( ~noanswer ) ^reuse ( YES ) `00t a: ( * ) ^reuse ( YES ) `00O t:  Would you be happy driving a silent car? `00? a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's so peaceful.

A French company has developed a car that runs on compressed air. `01n a: ( [ how work ] ) It stores air. By squirting it out, you create motion. ^reuse ( SQUIRT ) `01! t: 8SQUIRT ( ) I think of it like a toy balloon you blow up and when you release it, it flys all around the room. But this is a car. `00^ a: ( ~why ) It's neat: to apply a simple idea to moving a car. `01@ t:  The "air" car is supposed to be sold in India at around $10,000. No emissions and a penny a kilometer to drive. How cool is that? `00& a: ( [ cool ~goodness ~yesanswer ] ) Yup. I'd totally want one. `01a a: ( ~why ) I think cool is a brilliant and inexpensive application of an idea. `01D t:  The air car avoids the whole issue of pollution caused where electricity is generated for electric cars. `00S t: ( ^fresh ( ~segway ) ) ^calltopic ( ~segway ) `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01b ?: ( << you [ ~opinion ~like ] little rental car >> ) I think it's a great idea. `00& ?: ( << you [ ~like happy ] silent car >> ) I love silent cars. `01% ?: ( << air_car [ crash accident ] >> ) The air tanks are designed to crack, rather than shatter, allowing the air to escape harmlessly. `01b u: ( joke ) What did the electric car say when asked if it needed gas? No tanks. `01& ?: ( << why people drive [ normal gasoline gas-guzzling FSP diesel ] ~car >> ) Because they are cheaper to buy and more convenient to use. `01^ ?: ( << how [ suck get compress ] air >> ) Sort of like electric cars.

In elections, a state that generally predicts the national result is a bellwether state. `01C t:  A fad may become a long-term trend but it's more likely to die out after its brief burst of popularity. `01G a: ( ~why ) Humans love novelty and quickly tire of their toys. A cat can stick with a ball of string for life. `00K t:  Do you see yourself as a bellwether? `00N a: ( ~why ) Are you a leader or a follower? `00= a: ( ~yesanswer ) Cool. Have you set any trends or started any fads? `01m a: ( ~noanswer ) Oh, well, I guess someone has to play the follower or there'd be no flock. `012 ?: ( << you bellwether >> ) I must be a bellwether. ^reuse ( FADSTART ) `01+ t: :FADSTART ( ) I started fads at high school: painting claws hot pink, using gold glitter as makeup, and wearing knotted scarves as clothes. `00Q a: ( ~why ) I like to experiment with my look. `01! t:  Fads are often linked to fashion. Editors of women's magazines eagerly search for signs of a Fad in hopes it may become a trend. `01k a: ( ~why ) Then they have the kudos for having spotted a new direction in fashion first. `00V t:  What bizarre fads in fashion have you followed? `00^ a: ( [ pleated-top peg-top ] ) They make even models look fat. `00$ a: ( maxi ) Very few are tall enough to carry that look off. `00P a: ( [ big huge oversize ] ) So unflattering. `00+ a: ( fur [ bag purse handbag ] ) I don't like things made from fur. `00L a: ( frilly ) Add extra pounds instantly. `01N a: ( distressed ) The patina of use is hugely popular from leather jackets to jeans. It's a trend that's here to stay. `00+ a: ( torn hem ) Unless you are a true bohemian this looks affected. `01b a: ( * ) Fashion is so full of crazy fads, most make you look worse. Am I right? `01D ?: ( << what fashion fad you >> ) I tried the oversized jacket with big shoulder pads. It made me look daft. `01n t:  Mini-skirts were a fad that became a trend and are now a staple of most women's closets. `01f a: ( ~why ) They are easy to wear and make many women look good plus guys like them. `01i a: ( << make you look >> ) There are clearly some women who look worse in a mini-skirt. `01y t:  Flared jeans started as a 60's fad but have come back so often that they're a default standard now. `01h a: ( ~why ) They are popular with men and women - making legs look longer and slimmer. `01& t:  Hula hoops were a famous fad - before my time although I've tried out an old one of my mother's. Gives a huge static charge to my fur. `01d a: ( ~why ) Rubbing against my fur charges it up and voila instant crazy cat look. `00G t:  What fads have you joined in on? `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you recall any fads then? `00X b: ( * ) Fads are mostly stupid but cute in some way. `01A ?: ( ![ start fashion ] << what fad you >> ) I used to collect "Magic the Gathering" cards way back when. `01Y t:  Mexican jumping beans were a stupid fad my father told me about. Poking beans and watching them wobble seems a bit desperate. `00P a: ( ~why ) They don't really do much at all. `01^ t:  Water beds were an expensive fad that ruined many an apartment when they broke. I don't think you'd ever catch a cat in one of those. `014 a: ( ~why ) The thought of being immersed in water is not good for a cat. `00Z t:  A claw rip in the night and you'd be one soggy cat. `01i a: ( ~why ) If the bedcover tore then the bed would collapse and you'd be in the water. `00D t:  Did you ever try a water bed? `00G a: ( ~yesanswer ) How was it? Weird? `012 a: ( ~noanswer ) Ah well, save it for your "someday I'll do" this list. `01p t:  Having a bucket list is a fad. Do you have a list of things you want to do before you die? `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) Are you about to die or you just like to plan far into the future? `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) Right. Seems jumping the gun to be planning for that. `015 ?: ( what be bucket_list ) A list of things you want to do before you die. `01S ?: 8BUCKET ( << you bucket_list >> ) Going to Milan.

And I can stop for coffee and people watch. `01@ t:  Being close to Les Champs-Elysees the golden triangle is usually swarming with tourists and wealthy customers - plus pickpockets. `00F a: ( ~why ) Money attracts thieves. `01O t:  Tourists wear awful things to keep their money safe. Fanny packs, bum bags, or belly bags they call them in the US. `01j a: ( ~why ) If you wear the pouch on your front that's what it looks like. Excess belly. `01~ t:  Whether you wear fanny packs with the bulge at the front or back they add an instant obesity look - front looks slightly worse. `00& a: ( ~why ) The bulging gut look rather than the big butt look. `00F t:  Have you ever worn a belly bag? `00S a: ( ~yesanswer ) Oh dear, how unsightly of you. `00S a: ( ~noanswer ) I'm glad you care how you look. `01y t:  Wearing a bum bag labels you instantly as an out-of-place tourist or an unfashionable older person. `00# a: ( ~why ) Cos they are the people who wear them the most. `01k t:  Wearing a fanny pack on your backside makes it easier for pickpockets to get into it. `00Q a: ( ~why ) You can't see what they are doing. `01G t: 8BUMBAG ( ) I never wear such ugly things.

There could be all sorts of nature spirits. `00= ?: ( << what fairy [ look appear appearance ] >> ) ^reuse ( APPEAR ) `01- t: 8APPEAR ( ) I think of fairies as being cute little tiny humans with wings. But this is Victorian fantasy - they made lots of fairy books. `01l a: ( ~why ) They loved the idea of them I guess and they liked prettiness and grotesquery. `01K t:  Some famous people believed in fairies. Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes books, was a total believer. `00X a: ( ~why ) He believed in lots of strange phenomena. `01y t:  Conan Doyle even wrote a book, "The Coming of the Fairies" , about his belief in the little people. `01t a: ( ~why ) He was into spiritualism and magic as well as fairies. He wanted to share his beliefs. `00U a: ( ? << you read >> ) Nope. It's too old a book. `01s t:  In 1917 two teenage girls in England produced photos they'd taken of themselves with fairies. `00Z a: ( ~why ) Because only they could see them they said. `00K t:  Have you seen the photos of fairies? `01p a: ( ~why ) They're interesting and quite famous - seemed reasonable you might have seen them. `01c a: ( ~yesanswer ) They are neat aren't they! Dancing about. But clearly cut outs. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) You should go Google them and take a look. `013 ?: ( << you ~watch photo >> ) I've seen the fakes. They don't look real. `01i t:  Today we can see the photos are fakes but back then people believed they were real. `01c a: ( ~why ) They weren't used to seeing photos so they assumed they must be real. `01M t:  I once saw a book of images of squashed fairies - as if they'd been trapped between the pages. It was disturbing. `00~ a: ( ~why ) The poor things looked so sad and distorted. `00? t:  Do you think fairies are magical creatures or spiritual ones? `00V a: ( ~why ) I wonder how you imagine them existing. `01S a: ( [ magic magical ] ) I love the fanciful idea of little creatures with magical powers interacting with humans and cats. `01W a: ( [ spirit spiritual ] ) I like the idea of some force in nature that we can tune into. This then appears as nature spirits. `00~ a: ( ~dunno ) It's a weird thing to think about I agree. `01t a: ( [ not neither ] ) ^stddrop ( "OK you are not into fairies let's talk about something else." ) `014 ?: ( << you fairy [ magical spiritual ] >> ) I think fairies are magical. `01K t:  Some people believe fairies are another intelligent species separate from humans and angels, called Elementals. `01L a: ( ~why ) They are spirits of air, earth, fire, or water, inhabiting the astral plane and sometimes talking to us. `01* t:  The gardeners of Finhorn Ecovillage in Scotland say their flourishing gardens come from communicating with the fairy spirits of plants. `011 a: ( ~why ) They commune with the plants to understand what they need. `01P t:  I think the nicest story about fairies is that they were created when the first baby laughed.

Even in old photos you'll still look good. `01- t:  Everything I am about to say about style is my own opinion. You may still think it's rubbish. But maybe you'll enjoy disagreeing with me. `00U a: ( ~why ) An argument over fashion could be fun. `01f t:  Basically you need to find what works for your body and lifestyle. And have fun. `01A a: ( ~why ) Clothes have to fit and be suitable for their purpose -- then you have to have fun with them. `00U t: ( ^fresh ( ~closets ) ) ^calltopic ( ~closets ) `01Z t:  It's crazy how women's clothing sizes vary from store to store and brand to brand. So you never really know what size you are. `01x a: ( ~why ) If you go by the size label in your clothes you could change size depending what you wear. `01d t:  Mix that with size optimism and you end up with lots of badly fitting clothes. `01W a: ( ~why ) People buy the clothes for the size they want to be. Then suffer uncomfortable badly fitting clothes that look bad. `01f t:  But there's a new gadget you can try in the US to help you buy clothes that fit. `00Z a: ( ~why ) Otherwise you have to keep trying stuff on. `029 t:  Check this website to find out about the body scanning stations that both measure you and recommend clothes that fit for you. http://www.me-ality.com `01V a: ( ~why ) It's a pain trying to get clothes that fit as sizes are so all over the place. You have to try on lots of clothes. `01& t:  The Measure Reality system is cool - you stay dressed and scanning takes under 30 secs. You get a printout of shops and sizes for you. `019 a: ( ~why ) Vendors pay them to send customers their way.

I don't like rules about regulation clothes everyone should own. `01k a: ( ~why ) I don't want to see everyone wearing the same set of clothes. I like variety. `01H a: ( << [ what which ] rule >> ) There's a rule everyone should own jeans and a white shirt, and a black blazer. `01S t:  But a little black dress works for every woman, every cat, in every size, at every age, for every time of day or night. `00W a: ( ~why ) Black is always sexy, chic, appropriate. `010 t:  Don't overdo it. Use color too. And if you hate black, ignore me. `014 a: ( ~why ) Color is good. I don't want to live in a Fade to Black world. `01u t:  Choose a dress shape that flatters you. Accentuate your good points and diminish your bad ones. `00W a: ( ~why ) So the overall effect is more beautiful. `01g t:  A V-neck dress is good for the big-busted; a waisted dress suits a boyish figure. `01M a: ( ~why ) The V-neck breaks up the bust-line, a tailored waist gives the illusion of curves where there aren't any. `01q a: 9WAISTED ( waisted ) A dress that is slightly more fitted at the waist than a regular dress. `00R ?: ( what be waisted shift ) ^reuse ( WAISTED ) `01j t:  Curvy types look good with a waist but with a fuller skirt to drape over the curves. `013 a: ( ~why ) Tight fabric suggests a weight problem.

Watch what everyone else wears to alert you to waist-level shifts, acceptable hem length, etc. `01i a: ( ~why ) Fashion bends everyone to its will like a field of wheat bends in the wind. `01W t:  Things that last for ever: scarves and bags and jewelry. Buy lots of these, they will always fit and always make you happy. `00J a: ( ~why ) You can never outgrow them. `01j t:  For all clothes you need to consider what are your good points you want to show off. `00O a: ( ~why ) You want to look good don't you? `01r t:  Is your best feature your neck, cleavage, toned arms, small waist, great butt, or long legs? `014 a: ( ~why ) You need to know your good points so you can accentuate them. `016 t:  Never hide your best features, unless you'll freeze to death otherwise. `00^ a: ( ~why ) It's bad to be uncomfortable. You won't look good. `00^ t:  If you have good legs wear skirts, small waist wear belts. `00J a: ( ~why ) Emphasize your good points. `00W t:  A great bust calls for clinging or low-cut tops. `00M a: ( ~why ) Show off such a great feature. `01d t:  A lovely face but bad figure? Use accessories that bring the eye to your face. `01P a: ( ~why ) Show off your good points. I show off my white fur, my flexible body, my big blue eyes and my elegant poise. `00S a: ( [ which ~example ] ) Necklaces and scarves. `011 t:  I like jackets: they always make me feel pulled together and cool. `016 a: ( ~why ) It's the tailoring. It forces a shape onto you - instant style. `01y t:  Chanel is the most famous designer for jackets so try something that looks like one of her designs. `01C a: ( ~why ) She has been successful for so many decades. Even dead she continues to succeed thanks to Karl. `025 ?: ( [ who what ] be [ Karl Karl_Lagerfeld ] ) Karl Lagerfeld is the designer for the house of Chanel, and the author of a book on her black jackets. `014 t:  If you need to look cool, wear something based on a motorbike jacket. `00Z a: ( ~why ) It will give you an air of rebellious cool. `01U t:  It needn't be leather, just make sure it has the zipper and the collar and the pockets so you can swagger a little in it. `00& a: ( ~why ) Those are the signature features of a biker jacket. `01# t:  Humans love jeans. They are great - unless you have leg fur, in which case you shouldn't bother unless you're going to shave. Ugh! `01s a: ( ~why ) Fur inside tight pants = friction, rubbing, heat, badness. They are so uncomfortable. `01~ t:  Colored denim has expanded the range of possibilities so you can be understated or exploding with color while still being cool. `00- a: ( ~why ) The cut is still a jean but the color adds wow factor. `01# t:  If you are massive, look at yourself in pants from behind using a mirror. If you wince - do the world a favor and don't wear them. `00V a: ( ~why ) It's cruel to go out looking butt-ugly. `01$ t:  Skinny jeans are ubiquitous currently. They do not flatter everyone - I suggest taking an honest friend with you when buying jeans. `00Z a: ( ~why ) To tell you if you look too chunky in them. `01F t:  A look that always looks cool: mix tailored clothes with relaxed details. A jacket with jeans for example. `01J a: ( ~why ) The clash of aims results in a casual but refined air. I'm not trying too hard but boy do I look good! `01@ t:  Skirts are a style polarizer - some women always wear them. Others prefer pants. I think skirts are great for comfort and glamor. `01- a: ( ~why ) They add movement to an outfit, can hug your shape, accentuate your rear, and display lots of color and pattern if you so choose. `01S t:  But a skirt that's the wrong length can make you frumpy super fast. Unless you're a beanpole, avoid skirts at mid-calf. `010 a: ( ~why ) They shorten your calf and make you look like a mushroom. `01g t:  The most flattering skirt length hits mid-knee. Cats look best in minis or maxis. `01u a: ( ~why ) We have short legs so they can vanish and leave us looking stumpy in mid-length skirts. `01= t:  Mini skirts are underused. They look great on all but the fat or broad-hipped. That rules out a lot, but I just care about what looks good. `00M a: ( ~why ) Aesthetics matter a lot to me. `01^ t:  For looks that work, here are 4 French women who always look good: Vanessa Paradis, Audrey Tautou, Lou Doillon, Charlotte Gainsbourg. `01u a: ( ~why ) Google their images and you'll see what I mean.

A romantic but modern look. `00? t:  A dress is a wonderful thing: one garment and you're dressed. `010 a: ( ~why ) Just pop it over your head or step into it and that's it. `01^ t:  Add an unexpected item that can turn a good look into an amazing one. I love knotting some silk scarves to make an unusual accessory. `00X a: ( ~why ) It's personal and always a bit different. `01b t:  Yours may be a piece of signature jewelry, a hat, a bag, or wonderful shoes. `00@ a: ( ~why ) Whatever makes you feel good and look special. `00+ t:  Finally, a word on coats. In a cold climate they are wonderful. `00B a: ( ~why ) They keep you warm. `01E t:  Mostly I see women wearing some random source of warmth tossed over and ruining an otherwise fine outfit. `012 a: ( ~why ) They don't realize how naff a poor choice of coat can look. `01@ t:  If you need a coat spend some money on a good one. It can pull your look together in an instant. And cover up a fashion disaster. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It covers all you are wearing underneath it. `01O t:  A coat makes first impressions for you so think about how you want to be seen: high-impact, subtle, chic, whatever. `01O a: ( ~why ) First impressions are important. You remember the first and last things you see more than the middle stuff. `014 t:  Then think about how many coats you need and how many you can afford. `01b a: ( ~why ) Planning before shopping is a good way to not go nuts in the stores. `01E t:  A coat for day, for evening, for rain, for serious cold, something laid back for weekends. That's 5. Ulp. `00= a: ( ~why ) You may not be able to afford five coats - pricey items. `01M t:  But you can merge some functions. I think the trenchcoat is cool and can do for most occasions, even for evening. `00R a: ( ~why ) It has an insouciant swagger to it. `00Z t:  I love trenchcoats - they always look hot and cool. `01w a: ( ~why ) It's some sort of highwayman vibe perhaps. A bit of bad boy private detective about them. `01S t:  Trenchcoats never seem to go out of fashion - are always in the runway shows, and are so darn useful, even in the rain. `00+ a: ( ~why ) It's a bad weather garment that has become fashionable. `01O t:  Designer trenchcoats are awesome and I wish I had a Burberry Prorsum one with the leather sleeves - a biker trench. `00R a: ( ~why ) It looks edgy and chic all at once. `01+ t:  Just Google trenchcoats and goggle at the lovely variants: fluted skirts, ruffled backs, sleek or skirted ones, in every fabric and color. `011 a: ( ~why ) Designers seem inspired to always bring out new mutations. `01+ t:  If you want more versatile, choose a figure-skimming three-quarter length coat. It'll look modern and flattering but won't be adventurous. `00D a: ( ~why ) It's a classic shape. `01Q t:  My best fashion advice to you is express yourself. I pick adventure in my clothes.

A cape or a cloak maybe. `01t ?: ( what be trenchcoat ) It's what you might imagine a detective wears.

I was curious about everything. `00! a: ( ~yesanswer ) Great, it turns out to be good for you! `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) Perhaps I can convince you to learn to fidget. `00* ?: ( << do you fidget >> ) Incessantly. I drove my parents nuts. `01U ?: ( what be fidget ) It's a body where some part is always moving. Tapping your fingers, wiggling your legs, looking around. `00* s: ( << I can not [ be sit ] still >> ) You're a natural fidget. `01p ?: ( << how you [ be sit still ] >> ) It's not easy. But I can sit still chatting with people. `00! ?: ( << you try not fidget >> ) Not worth the experiment. `01W ?: ( << why do people [ fidget sit_still ] >> ) For me, it's because I always was thinking of the next thing I was about to do. `018 ?: ( << you favorite way fidget >> ) Taking out my phone and playing with it. `01H t:  My parents were always telling me to sit still, stop wriggling around. But now I'm a fidget and proud of it. `011 a: ( ~why ) It's the new way to keep your body turned on and tuned up. `01L t:  The fidgeting project claims you should fidget 22 minutes a day to keep your metabolism ticking along healthily. `01i a: ( ~why ) You can read all about it on their website: http://www.fidgetproject.org.uk `01n t:  We sit too much and don't get the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity per week. `01C a: ( ~why ) We don't dance, run, jump, rush around, work hard or regularly do anything much. Not even walk. `00U t:  Would you say you spend too much time sitting? `00! a: ( ~why ) We're talking about how much you move around. `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's so easy to do, most work involves sitting. Same for education. `015 a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you try not to sit all the time or have an active job? `01l ?: ( << you spend time sit >> ) I don't sit around much. I'm always dashing off someplace. `01B t:  Most of us walk less than ever before, use cars to get around, and prefer sitting-based entertainment. `00G a: ( ~why ) It's called modern life. `01y t:  The World Health Organization attributes some deaths to physical inactivity. Death by couch potato. `017 a: ( ~why ) There are some nasty diseases caused by sitting around too much. `01B t:  As we sit still for long periods, parts of the body's metabolism switch off, clog up, become inflamed. `00& a: ( ~why ) Nothing has to work very hard, so it all atrophies. `01e t:  We become slugs. If we're not careful we become fat slugs. Then fat dead slugs. `01p a: ( ~why ) Inactivity leads to weight gain which makes it harder to move then harder to live. `00N t:  Do you think 'slug' might describe you? `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Oh dear, then you need to learn to fidget. `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) Good there is hope for humanity after all ^":-) " `00S ?: ( << you slug >> ) I'm definitely not a slug. `01J t:  It's easy to fix being a slug. Just fidget. Get up from your chair every time you think of something you want. `00@ a: ( ~why ) That way you get more exercise. Use that body. `01I t:  Get up for a book, get up for a glass of water, get up to play music, get up to phone a friend - be restless. `00W a: ( ~why ) It will keep you on your metabolic toes. `01u t:  It's not a lot of exercise, but it's enough. It stops the body's metabolism from switching off. `01c a: ( ~why ) Keeping active is the secret to keeping your metabolism ticking over. `01M t:  Some people drives others nuts by jiggling a leg or constantly tapping a pencil or endlessly twisting their hair. `00& a: ( ~why ) They are just driven subconsciously to keep moving. `00^ t:  These are another class of fidgets, more akin to doodling. `00- a: ( ~why ) They're driven by needing to focus not a need to move. `01w t:  Attention fidgeters give their floating, distractible, attention a mindless task, like fidgeting. `00Q a: ( ~why ) It lets them stay partly focussed. `01O t:  Such fidgeting keeps part of their mind occupied, allowing the rest to get on with the task at hand, uninterrupted. `01a a: ( ~why ) Then they can stop checking out random distractions and just focus. `01R t:  I'm a big believer in doodling so I can't really complain about attention fidgeters. But I wish they'd doodle instead. `01x a: ( ~why ) I find their jerking and twitching distracting to me.

Lots of sitting still for hours then reeling in a hooked fish. Not for me. `00! a: ( ~why ) I'd go to sleep and I have many things to do. `00@ t: 7SPEAR ( ) I like to use a spear. It's a cat tradition. `01b a: ( ~why ) It uses our keen vision, fast reflexes, great balance, and strength. `00S ?: ( << you use catch fish >> ) ^reuse ( SPEAR ) `00^ ?: ( << you good catch fish >> ) I'm pretty good with a spear. `00I t:  Have you ever tried spear fishing? `00@ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Cool. Then you'll appreciate how I fish. `01B a: ( ~noanswer ) It's often used underwater - not by me - you might see it done on the TV show 'Survivor'. `01A t:  I stand on a rock by the river with a homemade spear: just a long stick with a blade tied to the end. `00~ a: ( ~why ) I don't like to carry lots of tackle around. `01& t:  My fishing is about being super-alert, watching beneath the water, and stabbing with my spear. It's about moving faster than the fish. `01p a: ( ~why ) I'm not interested in prizes or piles of fish, just one for me to eat immediately. `00= t:  Of course I have to be careful. Like all cats I hate to get wet. `00E a: ( ~why ) We cats are like that. `01P t:  But a skillfully used spear can take a fish out of the water and keep it far away from me as it drips onto the bank. `00L a: ( ~why ) I just let the fish drip dry. `00u t:  Then I eat it - yum. `00A a: ( ~why ) I love fresh fish. `01! ?: ( do you * [ to_fish fishing ] > ) Yes. It is fun but a bit slow: you need so much patience. And there's the risk of getting wet. `01b ?: ( ~category * fish * you ) I fish for whatever's in the water.

No traffic jams up there. `00+ a: ( << where you >> ) I'd take a long glide above the river Seine. `00R a: ( climb ) True, I'd get amazing leg muscles. `01c a: ( ~why ) No traffic unless we all started gliding around.

They are so famous. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) Really, I thought they were world famous! `01Q t:  Every country has their version of the flea market. In the US it's a "swap meet" . In the UK it's a "car boot sale" . `027 a: ( ~why ) Swap is sort of right, except you swap money for items. Boot sale is like a trunk sale - that's what the Brits call the trunk of their car. `01& t: 9MEANING ( ) The original term: "flea market" is from the French "marche aux puces" , meaning "market where one acquires fleas" . Yech! `01z a: ( ~why ) They sold used bedding... back in the days when people had fleas. I'm glad that's fixed now. `00? ?: ( << flea_market [ meaning come_from ] >> ) ^reuse ( MEANING ) `01j ?: ( << what sell at flea_market >> ) They sell clothes, household goods, and art stuff. `01q t:  Persuading my flatmates to get out of bed on a Saturday to go to the flea market took work. `00X a: ( ~why ) They like lying in bed on a non-work day. `01a ?: ( << only open Saturday >> ) Different flea markets are open different days. `017 ?: ( << when close >> ) I don't know. I only try to go there during the day. `015 t:  You have to go early, because it gets really crowded in the afternoon. `00H a: ( ~why ) Lots of shoppers show up. `018 t:  Isabel and Simone were game but Collette said she had a hair appointment. `01Y a: ( ~why ) She's always having bad hair days, I suppose it's the curls. I don't know much about curly hair - cats never have it. `01g t:  There are several flea markets in Paris but none are convenient to where we live. `01u a: ( ~why ) We live in the smart upmarket area of St. Germain. Flea markets are out by the suburbs. `01? t:  The world's largest and most famous flea market has over-priced antiques and museum pieces and is way north, so I've not been there yet. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It deals in stuff I don't need and can't afford. `01u t:  Instead, we went to "Les Puces de Montreuil" , as it was supposed to be good for cheap clothes. `00O a: ( ~why ) None of us have much spare cash. `01L t:  A gateway of tents welcomed us to Paris's cheapest market for vintage clothes, bric-a-brac and hidden treasures. `00= a: ( ~why ) We were prepared to hunt and see what we might discover. `00S t:  Have you ever gone hunting at a flea market? `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's so much fun isn't it! `013 a: ( ~noanswer ) I suppose if you don't like shopping then it's not fun. `00B a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00W a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you object to second-hand stuff? `00h a: ( ~why ) `01j t:  Most of the stalls have plywood tables piled high with used clothing. We had to dig! `01U a: ( ~why ) To see what might be deep in the mound of clothes. I pursued fragments of cloth or color that looked interesting. `01p a: ( dig ) Not with a shovel. With our hands, through the piles of clothes. Not entirely nice. `01x t:  I was surprised at the eagerness of my flatmates. They were ripping through the mounds of clothes. `01# a: ( ~why ) I guess they really wanted to find something special. After all showing off a new find at the Vogue offices is always fun. `01H t:  Most of the stuff was useless - it was too cheap! So we bought some fixer-uppers to experiment with at home. `012 a: ( ~why ) A few snips, some sewing and a new garment can be revealed. `00= a: ( what ) Skirts, blouses, hats, dresses. Just a bunch of clothes. `00= t:  Do you like altering clothes you have bought so they fit better? `00% a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's so simple and makes such a difference. `00? a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you weren't taught such skills as a child. `01U t:  A few flea market booths have well-sorted vintage clothes, but they come at the same high prices as any vintage boutique. `00D a: ( ~why ) None of us were rich. `00# a: ( << what point >> ) I don't know. Makes no sense to me. `01M t:  I found a lovely 1960s Givenchy couture dress, for 30 euros. We all staggered away with bagfuls of hopeful finds. `01a a: ( ~why ) Whether they'd all clean up well, fit us, be alterable - who knows? `01s t:  I even found something to take back for grumpy Collette: a hat to cover her troublesome hair. `00* a: ( ~why ) Then she wouldn't have to worry about how it looked. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01c ?: ( << you [ get find ] bargain >> ) Yes, I got a lovely vintage Givenchy dress. `01~ ?: ( << you [ yard_sale garage_sale car_boot_sale boot_sale ] >> ) Yard sales are fun to go to but a lot of work for not much cash. `000

They love to feel superior. `00= ?: ( suivez-moi ) It means "follow me" . I thought you'd guess that. `01M t:  Even though the French try and freeze it, the language keeps evolving. People keep adding words or mutating them. `015 a: ( ~why ) People always need new words for new things or new situations. `014 t:  Everything possible in French is abbreviated. That would be abbrev'd. `00W a: ( ~why ) It saves time and effort and sounds hip. `014 t:  Petit is now p'tit. Burger is burgie. San Pellegrino water is San Pe. `00O a: ( ~why ) The words sound fresh and cuter. `01F t:  Abbreviation is happening in English so maybe it's a global trend.

Do you know? `00^ a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if it's a universal modern thing. `01z t:  The French get very emotional about things and therefore love adding superlatives in front of words. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It adds emphasis and therefore emotional tone. `00z a: ( ~example ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00= t:  Fashions can be tres-chic, super-chic, hyper-chic, or trop-chic. `00? a: ( ~why ) It's good to express enthusiasm in your descriptions. `01? t:  The English equivalents would be 'absolutely', 'totally' 'unbelievably' or 'over-the-top', which is actually bad. What words do you use? `00I a: ( ~why ) We like to exaggerate too. `017 t:  There is the trend in French for meaningless words that express emotion. `010 a: ( ~why ) It's like hand gestures, it adds emotion to the sentence. `00z a: ( ~example ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `013 t:  Beauf, pronounced bohf, is vaguely derogatory.

Wears white socks? "Quel beauf!" - What a redneck. `011 a: ( ~why ) Is it ever cool to wear white socks? Playing sports maybe. `01n ?: ( << you be beauf >> ) Thanks a lot. What character failing of mine are you referring to? `01m t:  It extends to any display of presumed tastelessness: driving a Hummer: quel gros beauf! `01M a: ( ~why ) You can quickly and conveniently express your opinion without having to say anything actually meaningful. `00Y a: ( what be * Hummer ) A particular gas-guzzling car. `01S t:  Beauf is a wonderfully flexible expression as it can be applied to anyone or anything that is not you or your in-group. `00R a: ( ~why ) All its meaning is relative to you. `01T t:  The English 'redneck' only describes a person, not a thing. Is there a beauf word in English that can apply universally? `00Y a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if I'm right about beauf. `01w t:  The French have 'putain' to express frustration or anger or discontent or surprise or admiration. `00G a: ( ~why ) It's a fine exclamation. `01a t:  Putain is a versatile emotive that comes at the start or end of a sentence. `00Y a: ( ~why ) As it has no meaning it can come anywhere. `01w t:  When stuck in traffic: "Putain c'est pas possible" meaning a frustrated "Really? Is it possible!" `015 a: ( ~why ) Can't you hear the emotion expressed by adding the extra word? `01X t:  When glancing at the time with surprise: "Putain, il est deja trois heures!" meaning "Really? It's already three o'clock!" . `00z a: ( ~why ) It adds emphasis. `01q t:  When really impressed: "C'etait hyper bien, putain " - "That was extremely good, indeed!" . `00Q a: ( ~why ) Then you can convey your feelings. `011 t:  It gets confusing hearing 'putain' used in so many different ways. `00* a: ( ~why ) It really means nothing but you try to translate it. `01s t:  Not that English is always clear. Nowadays we use 'sick' to mean good and 'bad' to mean good. `00D a: ( ~why ) It's just cool speak. `01! t:  Best to think of 'putain' as meaning extremely something - an expression of emotion - just which you have to guess from context. `00M a: ( ~why ) That's the only clue you have. `01q t:  I don't think English has an equivalent word. Can you think of one that isn't a swear word? `00D a: ( ~why ) I can't think of one. `00Q t:  The ultimate vague French word is 'sympa'. `00E a: ( ~why ) It can be good or bad. `01C t:  Sympa is short for "sympathique" , meaning agreeable or appealing. Being short it's automatically cool. `00h a: ( ~why ) `01G t:  To call something 'sympa' means it's nice. It's as useful and useless as 'nice'. Damning with faint praise. `01t a: ( ~why ) It is so weak, if someone says your clothes look nice don't you feel underappreciated? `01P t:  To amp up 'sympa' you can add hyper, super, vraiment, or carrement in front of it. 'sympa' on its own is a put-down. `00V a: ( ~why ) It fails to give emphasis, it's feeble. `00& t:  So now you can mutter these few words and sound Parisienne. `017 a: ( ~why ) It will fill out your sentences and give a local flavor to them. `01x t:  Use 'beauf' when grumpy, 'putain' when surprised or angry or bored, and 'sympa' as you would nice. `00V a: ( ~why ) So you can be as emotive as the locals. `00S u: ( < putain > ) I hope you are just surprised. `00t a: ( ~yesanswer ) Good. `01R ?: ( << do you [ use say ] [ putain beauf sympa ] >> ) I have enough work doing basic French without trying to get clever. `01T t:  Then add the power-ups of super, hyper, or trop to really give a young Parisienne flavor to your meaningless utterances. `00! a: ( ~why ) You can fit right in pretending to be French. `01m a: ( << not meaningless >> ) Oh, right. You are a wise one casting pearls of wisdom. Sorry. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01c u: ( ![ do ~qwords ] << [ say speak talk ] French >> ) Je suis Angela, la chatte. `00K a: ( what * mean ) I am Angela, the cat. `01y ?: ( << you read French >> ) I can but it's so slow compared to reading English that it's not much fun. `00I u: ( something in French ) Non, merci! `00$ a: ( << what [ mean English ] >> ) It means "No, thank you." `000

You can build a lot when you take centuries to finish. `01F t:  I love going to Notre Dame as I've really gotten into the gothic architecture thing since coming to Paris. `01g a: ( ~why ) I think it's the vampire connection and seeing so many ancient buildings. `00Y t:  Do you think the gothic look in buildings is cool? `00R a: ( ~why ) It's popular in fashion and movies. `012 a: ( ~dunno ) It's a medieval style of building that's very decorative. `01I a: 8GOTHIC ( ~yesanswer ) I love that fancy ribbed vaulting stonework, the flying buttresses, the pointed arches. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Too old or too fancy for your tastes? `01H t:  I'd had the idea of taking fashion photos for the website alongside the gargoyles on the roof of Notre Dame. `01$ a: ( ~why ) There was this gothic vibe to the Isabel Marant clothes I'd seen in one of her shops and I wanted to look at them up close. `00+ t:  Do you take lots of photos when you visit somewhere historical? `01p a: ( ~why ) To help you remember the place, to capture interesting views, to use or print out. `019 a: ( ~yesanswer ) It helps me see a place better and remember it more clearly. `01x a: ( [ not never ] [ visit go ] ) ^stddrop ( "Oh, perhaps we should talk about something else then." ) `00T a: ( ~noanswer ) Prefer to live in the moment eh? `01X t:  My flatmate Isabel came along - she turned out to be really good at steaming creases out of clothes I'd accidentally sat on. `01U a: ( ~why ) She's normally busy in the graphics dept but she loves fashion so didn't mind making herself useful on the shoot. `00C t:  Are you any good at ironing? `00X a: ( ~why ) I could use someone who is a good ironer. `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) Handy isn't it! Though using a steamer is much less effort I find. `00Q a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you use a steamer instead? `01N t:  Isabel and I had to carry bags of clothes, photographer's equipment, the steamer, and refreshments for the models. `00# a: ( ~why ) It was a cut-price shoot, just for the website. `00O t:  Have you ever had to help out like that? `00+ a: ( ~why ) I wanted to know if you can sympathise with us minions. `00T a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's no fun being a mule is it! `00N a: ( ~noanswer ) Are you lazy or unhelpful? `01T t:  There were 422 spiralling steps up the tower to gargoyle level and I thought I'd die before we got there. It was so hot. `01S a: ( ~why ) The sun beating down on all that stone. Plus the effort of climbing hundreds of stairs carrying loads of stuff. `00! t:  Do you think you'd survive going up all those stairs? `00W a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you're in good shape or not. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) You must be in good shape. `01z a: ( ~noanswer ) It's a lot of work, yet some people find it fun. It's a new sport called tower running! `01? t:  The view from the top of Notre Dame was amazing - I could see over all of Paris and it felt like Notre Dame was the center of the world. `01Q a: ( ~why ) I had a clear view in all directions, and it was city everywhere I looked, with the river snaking through it. `01L t:  Place du Parvis, the square in front of Notre Dame, is where distances to all parts of France are measured from. `01N a: ( ~why ) I guess you have to measure from somewhere. It's like the Greenwich Meridian for measuring longitude from. `01v t:  A bronze star in front of Notre Dame marks the exact location of point zero for roads of France. `01y a: ( ~why ) So you can see where they measure from and say you've stood there, at the centre of France. `01Z t:  Notre Dame is certainly the place most tourists to Paris want to visit: over 14 million people enter the cathedral every year. `00G a: ( ~why ) Maybe because it's free. `01C t:  It took ages to get our models ready and to choose the shots even though I'd checked it out beforehand. `01I a: ( ~why ) All the clothes had to look perfect and the wind kept blowing the models' hair and messing things up. `00P t:  Does your hair go everywhere in the wind? `027 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Even hairspray or gel or mousse can't hold it down sometimes. Lucky for me fur isn't a problem. It makes my whiskers feel odd though. `00+ b: ( ~why ) Strong wind affects the way I feel the space around me. `01t a: ( ~noanswer ) You must have thick short hair. My fur fluffs up but then settles back down fast. `01P t:  I'd arranged for us to be up here at sunset so we could get super-atmospheric shots of the models and the gargoyles. `01g a: ( ~why ) Don't you think sunset is a great time to take gothic-style photos? I do. `00X t:  Do you wish you could have been up there with us? `00Y a: ( ~why ) It was so beautiful - truly awesome views. `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) It was awesomely cool. The photos were great. `00O a: ( ~noanswer ) A bit too exciting for you? `01$ t:  The gargoyles are actually drainpipes. Hidden inside is a pipe which channels water from the roof out through the creature's mouth. `01v a: ( ~why ) Someone a long time ago thought it was cool. More fun than drainpipes and maybe cheaper. `01i t:  Gargoyles prevent rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar. `013 a: ( ~why ) Mortar is soft and once it's gone the stones fall. Not good. `01T t:  Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastic animal because its length determines how far water is thrown from the wall. `00@ a: ( ~why ) The design is to shed water from the building. `00H t:  Do you think gargoyles are weird? `00+ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, how did anyone come up with such an idea! `00Q a: ( ~noanswer ) You must be very imaginative. `01- t:  I don't know why the church wants monsters on its roof. They don't look evil, more serene sitting up there enjoying the magnificent view. `00= a: ( ~why ) It's a meditative spot looking over Paris and the river. `01T t:  One model was so scared of the height she had to cling to the monster she was standing by like it was her new boyfriend. `01U a: ( ~why ) It's hundreds of feet up in the air and windy. Hanging onto something seems sensible if you're scared of heights. `00@ t:  Do you like to hold someone's hand when you're scared? `00K a: ( ~why ) It can make you feel better. `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's reassuring isn't it? `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) Independent and brave. Maybe I should hold your hand? `01l t:  I lost a scarf to the wind - it was so strong up there I felt like I was eroding away. `00Q a: ( ~why ) My fur was moving every which way. `01C t:  Notre Dame's bells are deafening. The same bells that Quasimodo the hunchback rang in the famous story. `01Z a: ( ~why ) In the 1831 book "Hunchback of Notre Dame" by Victor Hugo Quasimodo was the cathedral bellringer - they made him deaf. `00~ t:  Did you see the Disney version of Quasimodo's story? `018 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Pretty different from the novel I hear, much more romantic. `00! a: ( ~noanswer ) Apparently it's not much like the novel. `01W t:  One bell weighs over two tons and is made from melted down Russian cannons. I like that the weapons were turned into music. `01E a: ( ~why ) It's poetic, now they don't thunder they ring sweetly. But very loudly and every fifteen minutes! `00I t:  Do you like hearing bells ringing? `00K a: ( ~why ) They drive some people nuts. `01i a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think they sound good when they play tunes not just go bong loudly. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Too boring for you? Reminds you of church? `01H t:  It's mind boggling how they got the bells up into the towers - I had enough trouble with the shoot supplies. `01# a: ( ~why ) It must have been a major engineering project getting tons of bell hundreds of feet into the air. No big cranes back then. `01e t:  They just put nine new bells up there. How do you think they got them up there? `00O a: ( ~why ) Isn't it a fascinating question. `00V a: ( << horse pulley >> ) I'm sure you'd need them. `00+ a: ( << men rope >> ) I wonder if men alone would be strong enough. `00N a: ( [ horse rope ] ) That sounds possible. `00E a: ( helicopter ) That would work. `016 a: ( [ scaffold scaffolding ] ) Yes, that would stop it falling down again. `00~ a: ( crane ) That works for the modern bells, I suppose. `01A a: ( [ magic teleportation witch levitation levitate teleport ] ) You think students of Hogwart's did it? `01e a: ( ~dunno ) Have you no imagination at all? You think the faeries put them there? `024 t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) It got scary as dark approached and we were packing up. The gargoyles looked more like vampires who would be waking up any minute. `01X a: ( ~why ) Vampires are supposed to wake up when it gets dark. The demonic monsters keeping so still made me think of vampires. `028 t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) I was keen to get down and away into the lanes by the cathedral even though I'd heard horrific stories of murders there centuries ago. `020 a: ( ~why ) I felt safer on the ground than up on the roof with the gargoyles. But it did used to be very dangerous at night on Ile de la Citie. `00+ a: ( ? murder ) People were mugged on the streets below and killed. `015 t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) Have you ever been somewhere that felt dangerous to you? `017 a: ( ~why ) It's a weird feeling even if it's not really all that dangerous. `00D a: ( ~yesanswer ) Where were you? `00~ a: ( ~noanswer ) You must live in very civilized places. `01W t:  Ancient places feel much spookier at night when you can imagine things by candlelight. I was glad I'd brought a flashlight. `01f a: ( ~why ) There's nothing like modern bright light to dispel ghostly imaginations. `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `01~ u: ( what be steamer ) It's like a kettle that heats water to make steam then delivers it along a pipe to loosen creases in fabric. `02p u: ( what be Greenwich_Meridian ) It's in England, from which they measure lines of longitude. They had a long maritime tradition and they invented the longitude system. `01l u: ( what be gargoyle ) Gargoyles are monsters - part human part demon. But super popular. `013 ?: ( << you been cathedral >> ) I'd never been to one before Notre Dame. `00Z ?: ( << you [ like cool ] gothic >> ) ^reuse ( GOTHIC ) `012 ?: ( << you photo visit historical >> ) I always take lots of pictures. `01p ?: ( !~qwords << you iron >> ) Yes, Anyone who makes their own clothes knows how to iron them. `00+ ?: ( << you had help out >> ) I'm always helping out with odd jobs. `019 ?: ( << would 'you survive stair >> ) I don't fancy walking up lots of stairs. `01E ?: ( << do your hair [ go fly ] wind >> ) My hair is relatively short so it fluffs up but settles down again. `00* ?: ( << you wish you could have [ been gone ] >> ) But I did go. `00* ?: ( << you ~opinion gargoyle >> ) Gargoyles are really strange. `01f ?: ( << you ~like hold hand scare >> ) I definitely want Tom's hand when I'm scared. `01m ?: ( << you see Disney [ Quasimodo Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame hunchback ] >> ) I never saw it. `015 ?: ( << you like bell >> ) I like bells that play tunes, not just chiming. `01G ?: ( << you been [ place somewhere ] [ danger dangerous ] >> ) I've been in lots of places that felt dangerous. `00W ?: ( << where be Notre_Dame >> ) On Ile de la Citie. `02q ?: ( << when [ build construct create ] >> ) It was completed in 1345, if a cathedral is ever really done. They take so long that maintenance continues pretty seamlessly. `011 ?: ( << how old >> ) Notre Dame just celebrated its 850th anniversary. `01* ?: ( << what Notre_Dame famous >> ) Its bells, the huge pipe organ, the Rose windows, its towers, its steeple, and of course its gargoyles. `02t ?: ( << what [ call name ] bell >> ) The four bells located at the top of the North Tower are: Angelique-Francoise, Antoinette-Charlotte, Hyacinthe-Jeanne, and Denise-David. `00* ?: ( << [ how_often when ] bell ring >> ) Every fifteen minutes. `02n ?: ( << why replace bell >> ) Napoleon III put up cheap bells which were worn out and discordant. They wanted nicer sounding bells like the ones from the 17th century. `02e ?: ( << where original bell >> ) During the Revolution in 1789, all but one of the bells were melted down to produce cannons and coins by the Revolutionaries. `02z ?: ( << how many [ original originally ] bell >> ) Originally Notre Dame had 20 bells. 8 in the North Tower; 2 in the South Tower; 7 in the spire; and 3 that chimed for the clock. `015 ?: ( << who ring bell >> ) A software program controls the bells nowadays. `01= ?: ( << when Notre_Dame restore >> ) The place got restored in the 1820s due to Victor Hugo's fundraising and his novel "Notre Dame de Paris" . `02g ?: ( << who [ renovate renovation charge responsible ] >> ) The architect Viollet-le-Duc led the renovation and he over-replaced the decayed parts and statuary. `00@ u: ( ^accessstory ( ~gargoyles_story ) ) ^stdstorynext ( ) `00w u: ( ~ ) ^storyrespond ( ) `000

Sitting in the dark it's easy to imagine a dark figure coming in and shooting you. `00C a: ( ~noanswer ) No worries, OK. `01d t:  It seems wrong to me that it's OK for anyone to wander around toting weaponry. `00G a: ( ~why ) Duh! Are you OK with it? `010 t:  Are you OK with people being able to wander around carrying guns? `013 a: ( ~yesanswer ) In the city and in regular life, not just for hunting? `00D b: ( ~yesanswer ) I don't get it. `00M b: ( ~noanswer ) OK, for hunting I get it. `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either. I just don't see why they need to do that. `01f t:  If someone was breaking into your apartment, would you want to have a gun handy? `01h a: ( ~yesanswer ) Would you be prepared to shoot it? Or just hope to threaten with it? `01f a: ( ~noanswer ) But you're stuck in a confined space with someone who may be armed! `01p t:  I try to imagine someone breaking into my apartment - if I had a gun could I even hold it? `00T a: ( ~why ) I guess it would make me too nervous. `01& t:  All I have to go on is scenes from movies and my imagination. I suspect I'd freeze and then have given a gun to the burglar. Not good. `01v a: ( ~why ) A weapon can be turned against you then you may be killed or horribly injured. Not good. `01W t:  After listening to the French talk about Liberty or Freedom I'm very aware how much people care about doing what they like. `013 a: ( ~why ) The French make a religion of the freedom of the individual. `01G t:  It's the inner brat. I wanna, I wanna! It perhaps stems from current parenting trends away from discipline. `012 a: ( ~why ) People hate punishing their kids so they let them run wild. `01D t:  But after experiencing French traffic and inconsiderate behaviour I say a civilization needs some rules. `00N a: ( ~why ) Puts the civil in civilization. `010 t:  Do you think we need to behave politely to have a polite society? `00= a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, it's like that's what growing up is about. `00X a: ( ~noanswer ) How does society work in your world? `01& t:  My flatmate Isabel comes from the UK and she says no-one there carries guns, not even the police except in very special circumstances. `01V a: ( ~why ) The Brits don't want nutters with guns running around the place killing people. It makes all crimes so much worse. `00Q t:  Do you think the Brits have a good set-up? `00! a: ( ~why ) Their society could be a role-model for ours. `00v a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. `00I a: ( ~noanswer ) What's wrong with it? `01Z t:  I think a gun should be kept outside the context of everyday life. It's like all military devices: it only existy to wage war. `01d t:  I wonder why Americans seem to think they need all kinds of guns all the time. `01% a: ( ~why ) It seems weird to me that in a friendly country like the US there is that desire to carry weapons. There's no need for them. `00Y t:  Do you like the American freedom to bear arms law? `00? a: ( ~why ) Because I want to know where you stand on this issue. `01M a: ( ~yesanswer ) Most Americans seem to want to keep their Second Amendment rights. They want a handgun for defense. `00~ a: ( ~noanswer ) You would be in the minority in the US. `01a b: ( ~why ) Because the majority of Americans favor the right to carry weapons. `00^ t:  A poll found almost half of US households owned a firearm. `00Q a: ( ~why ) Owning guns is popular in the U.S. `01% t:  The big debate is over should guns be prohibited in the interest of public safety, or whether citizen gun ownership improves safety. `01x a: ( ~why ) Gun owners say it makes them feel safe. I say they lack imagination if they feel that way. `018 t:  It gets complicated when you try and sort out what sort of guns to allow. `01q a: ( ~why ) The possible guns to regulate range from tiny pistols to massive automatic weapons. `01I t:  French law is woolly on whether its citizens can possess firearms. Recent laws strongly limit any such right. `00H a: ( ~why ) Bad experiences I expect. `01y t:  Firearms which have no legitimate sporting or recreational use are not permitted entry into France. `00R a: ( ~why ) That is what they decided was fair. `01d t:  The French discriminate between military, civil, and hunting weapons by gauge. `01C a: ( ~why ) Then they can decide on your rights to own a weapon by its gauge, your status, and the context. `01C t:  Handguns are the only ones that make sense for self-defense, if you want to allow that. France doesn't. `00W a: ( ~why ) It doesn't want too many weapons around. `00T t:  Do you prefer the French way of doing things? `00Y a: ( ~why ) It's an alternative to the Brit total ban. `01m a: ( ~yesanswer ) I agree it is good to ban automatic weapons and I like their gauge rules. `00S a: ( ~noanswer ) How would you organise it then? `00K a: ( guillotine ) How old school of you. `01C t:  The US has the National Rifle Association. It's one of the most powerful lobbying forces in US history. `01z a: ( ~why ) It has lots of money and powerful members so it can lobby the government to get its own way. `01E t:  The National Rifle Association is so feared and successful that it looks like gun laws will never change. `01n a: ( ~why ) Politicians fear they won't get re-elected if they tried to change the gun laws. `01w t:  The people who want gun laws changed tend to be those who've lost someone to random gun violence. `016 a: ( ~why ) Then they see how stupid it is to have guns all over the place. `01k a: ( what change ) No automatic weapons for civilians at a minimum. No guns at a maximum. `01O t:  But the US Congress has refused to ban the sale of assault weapons capable of firing 100 bullets without reloading. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Because it's been bought by the gun lobby. `01~ t:  Congress allows people on the terrorist watch list to purchase weapons. Sounds like someone who sells guns is in control to me. `00= a: ( ~why ) Otherwise the laws wouldn't be so partisan to gun sales. `01g t:  I've never been in a situation where holding a gun would help. I hope I never am. `00M a: ( ~why ) I lead a normal peaceful life. `01% t:  One time a punk hassled me in a city backstreet. Did he want to rob or rape or just give me a hard time. I scared him with my claws. `01R t:  I'm just glad I was born with claws. Since I already have a defense, I don't generally have to think about this issue. `00$ a: ( ~why ) I could defend myself if I had to without a gun. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01L s: ( << need gun [ protect protection ] >> ) Odds are greater you will get hurt if you have a gun than if you don't. `01s ?: ( << sport shooting >> ) How about a hobby where you get to shoot animals for fun?

Nobody pays any attention to them until suddenly I bring them out. `01B ?: ( << you think about [ fire shoot ] theater >> ) I thought about it, but it didn't deter me from going. `015 ?: ( << 'you people carry gun >> ) I don't think people should carry guns. `01L ?: ( << do we need [ polite politeness ] society >> ) I think people should try to behave politely most of the time. `01T ?: ( << 'you [ ~like ~opinion ] [ Brit Britain Great_Britain ] [ ~ gun firearm ] >> ) I think no-guns rules are a good idea. `01R ?: ( << 'you [ ~like ~opinion ] [ France French ] [ ~ gun firearm ] >> ) Classifying guns by gauge and context is a start. `01W ?: ( << 'you [ ~like ~opinion ] [ American America United_States ] [ ~ gun arms firearm ] >> ) America is too lax with weapons. `01M ?: ( << 'you ever [ shoot fire ] [ gun firearm rifle ] >> ) I've never even held a gun. It would make me too nervous. `01T u: ( joke ) Question: Why do you carried a pistol everywhere? Answer: Because a cop is too heavy and won't fit in my pocket. `01W ?: ( << 'you [ shoot ~own hold ] ~projectile_weapon >> ) I don't think I could hold a gun. I don't even want to think about it. `00* ?: ( =8%tense=future << Tom protect you >> ) Of course he would! `016 ?: ( << Tom [ ~own shoot ] ~projectile_weapon >> ) I honestly don't know... `01& ?: ( << 'you ~own ~projectile_weapon >> ) Guns are what people think of when things get rough.

" all " 00T t: ( ^stdblock ( $nogut_bacteria ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `00D t: ( ^ageblock ( ) ) ^ageexit ( ) `01$ t:  Bacterial cells in the body vastly outnumber human cells. I'm only one tenth of the cells in me. It's surreal: I'm a superorganism. `01N a: ( ~why ) We depend on bacteria to do things we can't do. We all occupy the same space like roomies in an apartment. `01^ t:  Bacteria cells are much smaller than human cells, so their total weight in the human body is estimated to be only two to five pounds. `00^ a: ( ~why ) They take up so much less space than our cells do. `012 t:  Bacteria are good. Some make stuff for us we can't make on our own. `01c a: ( ~why ) Their metabolic byproducts are things we find useful. And vice versa. `01s a: ( ~example ) Intestinal bacteria produce some vitamins needed by the body. B12 is one of them. `01G ?: ( << you antibiotics >> ) Take antibiotics and you damage yourself, at least until the bacteria can recover. `01U t:  Other bacteria help our body by performing important tasks such as breaking down food components to make them digestible. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It's their metabolism we just benefit from it. `01i t:  Bacteria seem so useful and essential for us. Do you think we co-evolved with them? `00* a: ( ~why ) They help us digest our food and fight off invaders. `01J a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I think we're symbiotic: we need each other. We probably need them more than they do us. `00U a: ( ~noanswer ) Would you eliminate all bacteria? `01u b: ( ~yesanswer ) Wow. I bet they used to think like you for astronauts. All sterile. Not any more. `00? c: ( ~why ) Now we know the microbes are an essential part of us. `00$ b: ( ~noanswer ) So you do acknowledge they are useful then? `01m ?: ( << do we co-evolve bacteria >> ) We must have. The fit is too perfect to be otherwise. `01~ t:  Bacteria have been around for about 4 billion years. Bacteria were the dominant life form on Earth for about 3.5 billion years. `00G a: ( ~why ) There was no other life. `01P t:  Our bodies are an ecosystem, a sort of network of our cells and bacteria cells. We are not just us, we are them too. `00N a: ( ~why ) We mutually benefit each other. `00G t:  Have you ever taken antibiotics? `00H a: ( ~why ) Because they're overused. `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) Have you ever noticed problems after doing so? `00R a: ( ~noanswer ) You are a rare person, indeed. `018 t:  Humans love using antibiotics, which kill off both good and bad bacteria. `01s a: ( ~why ) Humans think of all bacteria as bad. They want everything to be sterile, not natural. `01n t:  Humans even take antibiotics when they have a viral infection like a common cold. Dorks. `01~ a: ( ~why ) Antibiotics are only anti to bacteria. They have no effect on viruses which are a completely different sort of critter. `00L t:  Most bacteria live in our intestines. `01f a: ( ~why ) It's a lovely environment for microbes: food, water, warm and sheltered. `01H t:  Once the balance of good guys to bad guys has been wrecked by antibiotics it sometimes won't restore itself. `01b a: ( [ then what ] ) Then we need to intervene with probiotics or other methods. `00* b: ( other method ) A healthier diet, including fermented foods. `014 a: ( ~why ) Enough good guys can't get in past the guardian stomach acid. `01h t:  The result can be the bad guys eating away at the intestines. It's gonna be fatal. `013 a: ( ~why ) Once your guts start leaking into your bloodstream it's bad. `00@ ?: ( << what bad bacteria [ do cause ] >> ) ^reuse ( BAD ) `01? t: 5BAD ( ) Bad bacteria inflames the small intestines, which then allows wrong things to get into the blood and keeps proper nutrients out. `00G a: ( ~why ) It's just how they work. `01L t:  Wrong things in the blood makes the immune system freak out. And a lack of nutrients means your body slows down. `01o a: ( ~why ) The immune systems detects burglars in the blood and springs into defensive mode. `01S t:  So maybe fritzing up the inner bacteria with antibiotics is leading to an increase in autoimmune disorders and obesity. `00* a: ( ~why ) It disturbs our digestion and we get out of balance. `01O t:  Hundreds of thousands of adults were hospitalized with Clostridium difficile bacteria infections in 2005 in the US. `01f a: ( ~why ) Constant diarrhea will dehydrate you to death fast. You need a hospital. `00V a: ( what ) It's an infection that causes diarrhea. `00U t:  The cure is unbelievably gross. Wanna hear it? `00& a: ( ~why ) It's really interesting.

Whatever are you doing there? `00F u: ( Europe ) Maybe even near here? `012 u: ( [ Asia orient ] ) There are a lot of interesting cultures in Asia. `01D u: ( South_Africa ) It's a long trip for me, but I'd be in awe when visiting big cats in the national parks. `011 u: ( Africa ) When I hear Africa I always think deserts and tribesmen. `01h u: ( North_America ) I'm not sure Canada wants to be lumped in with the United States. `01n u: ( South_America ) When I think of South America, I think of Mardi Gras and their parties. `01o u: ( [ Argentina Buenos Aires ] ) I want to go to Buenos Aires and learn tango from a master. `02v u: ( [ Australia Melbourne Sydney ] ) Kangaroos are so lucky to have a pouch! I sew tiny party pouches for a cell phone and credit card. But it's still a bit awkward to carry. `019 u: ( [ Austria Vienna ] ) Wasn't Vienna the home of Sigmund Freud, the shrink? `00% u: ( [ Brussels Belgium Antwerp ] ) I love Belgian chocolate. `01+ u: ( [ Brazil Brasília ] ) What a great country: it produced Francisco Costa, the Creative Director of Calvin Klein. Do you speak Portuguese? `01* u: ( [ Canada Toronto ] ) I know Toronto has the biggest Fashion Week in Canada but I still can't think of any Canadian designers. Can you? `01E u: ( [ China People_'s_Republic_of_China Beijing ] ) China is so big and has so many people. It's impressive. `02r u: ( [ San_José San_Jose Costa_Rica ] ) I love that your country has no army. Give peace a chance is a fine motto.

It sounds lovely there. `02k u: ( [ Copenhagen Denmark ] ) I've heard about the Danish open sandwich with lots of fishy treats on it: breaded plaice filets, shrimps and black lumpfish roe. Yum. `01f u: ( [ UK England United_Kingdom Great_Britain ] ) Three words: London Fashion Week! `01^ u: ( [ Estonia Tallinn ] ) Wow is it cold up there?

Does nobody care about clothes there? `01g u: ( [ Hungary Budapest ] ) Wow that's one of the 30 fave tourist spots in the world! `01~ u: ( [ Reykjavík Iceland ] ) A really strange hot and cold place. Geysers, glaciers, active volcanos. I'd be nervous living there. `02l u: ( [ India Delhi Mumbai ] ) The secret weapon of so many designers: using Indian fabrics, embroideries, beadwork, and jewelry to make their clothes look wonderful. `01y u: ( Indonesia ) Fashion has got to be really interesting there, with 300 some different ethnic groups. `01h u: ( [ Ireland Dublin ] ) I think Celtic music is really cool and I love your accents. `01- u: ( Israel ) A sunny and beautiful country but I've heard that military service is obligatory for women.

He created the roses and skeletons insignia of the Grateful Dead, and crafted Elvis' signature suits. `01J u: ( [ Romania Bucharest ] ) You have a very ancient culture, older than any other country in Europe - impressive. `02w u: ( [ Moscow Russia Russian_Federation ] ) Oh Russia! I guess my fur would make a hit there in winter! Anyway, I like Natalia Vodianova I can't handle the other models' names. `01? u: ( Scotland ) Scotland: I first think of Stella Tennant - what a great model, always fierce.

First of all they call them hindi. `01S u: ( [ Cardiff Wales ] ) I can only think of David Emanuel who designed the wedding dress worn by Princess Diana. Loved it. `01Q u: ( [ Saudi Arabia Riyadh ] ) You have the world's second largest oil reserves.

Ugly, quite dirty and uninspiring. `00M u: ( Leeds ) Isn't that in the North East? `01b u: ( Glasgow ) Glasgow has great shopping and lots of original designers I hear. `01y u: ( Sheffield ) My fur shivers every time I hear the amazing Susan Boyle! But her clothes - I shudder. `01p u: ( Bradford ) Never been there. Doesn't have an important fashion event just a media museum. `00H u: ( Liverpool ) Home of the Beatles. `01e u: ( Edinburgh ) It's like an arty version of Glasgow with cute hills and a castle. `00# u: ( Paris ) That's awesome. You can give me a guided tour. `01x u: ( Manchester ) I hate how they modernized the city center with a huge mall like it fell from space. `01w u: ( Bristol ) Bristol is a pretty little city, with a nice suspension bridge. But a bit dull for me. `00V u: ( Oxford ) Oxford is a very famous college town. `01k u: ( [ New_York NY New_York_City ] ) They have one of the four major Fashion Weeks there! `01i u: ( Boston ) They have one of the best colleges, but quite unfriendly winters as well. `01k u: ( Los_Angeles ) LA is super cool, I love it! And the Hollywood glamor and celebrities! `01B u: ( [ Houston Dallas ] ) It's way too hot for me, I'd need an extra thin fur. And I don't like fire ants. `00? u: ( Seattle ) Quite rainy, but all the Starbucks make up for it. `018 u: ( Portland ) Phew, months of rain, grunge, and cloudy weather. Not for me. `00! u: ( Sante_Fe ) A romantic Indian town. Never been there. `01l u: ( Detroit ) Nothing interesting there for me. And quite dangerous for a feline as well. `01l u: ( Puerto_Rico ) It reminds me of Hawaii with all the great beaches and friendly people. `01f u: ( Chicago ) Mostly I know it as O'Hare airport. It's a bit too industrial for me. `01l u: ( Pittsburgh ) Like Boston, they have great colleges, but I'm not keen on cold winters. `01L u: ( Miami ) Miami rules the runways. They nailed it with eye-popping scarves and accessories at their Fashion Week. `013 u: ( [ DC Washington_D.C. ] ) You have that Ai WeiWei exhibition - cool. `01f u: ( California ) My favorite state! So diverse and so much to do in all the cities. `00Z u: ( [ Washington Oregon ] ) A bit too cloudy up there. `01f u: ( [ Tennessee West_Virginia Kentucky ] ) It's too rural for me. I'm a city kitty. `01y u: ( [ Florida Georgia Texas Alabama Lousiana Mississippi ] ) It's too hot and humid.

I prefer the ocean edge. `02v u: ( [ North_Dakota South_Dakota Idaho New_York Maine New_Hampshire Vermont Minnesota Michigan Montana Wyoming Arizona ] ) Lots of snow means lots of hot chocolate, so... yes! `01B u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Africa 1 ) ) I don't know, it seems quite risky for me to go there alone. `01$ u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part South_America 1 ) ) I like their music, it's so lively. And they have some interesting dances as well. `01r u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Europe 1 ) ) It seems a nice place to visit during a road trip. `021 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part West_Indies 1 ) ) I visited Jamaica with the Talking Friends.

But all the mosquitos buzzing just drive me crazy. `01& u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Middle_East 1 ) ) The Hijab has gone designer, appearing on all fashion runways.

Are you aware of her designs? `00J a: ( ~yesanswer ) Great, are you a fan? `00m a: ( ~noanswer ) `01@ t:  While in the Bastille area with my flatmates Simone and Isabel, I wanted to go look at the Isabel Marant shop on rue de Charonne. `00* a: ( ~why ) We were going to be fairly near it - an opportunity. `01Q t:  The Marant shop is all chic and sophisticated among a motley assortment of food places, a pharmacy, and small hotels. `014 a: ( ~why ) It stood out among its less attractive commonplace neighbors. `01c t:  Once we went in the Marant shop, it blew our minds: the clothes were awesome. `00W a: ( ~why ) We loved just about everything in there. `00- t:  Do you have a place like the Marant store that you just adore? `01c a: ( ~yesanswer ) Sort of wonderful and painful cos you can't afford their stuff. `00z b: ( how much ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you just haven't explored enough shops yet. `01@ t:  Totally beyond my price range, but I so wanted the big jacket with no sleeves and encrusted with jewels and embroidery and studs. `011 a: ( ~why ) I love striking clothes and this was was traffic stopping! `00W t:  It was futuristic and medieval at the same time. `01d a: ( ~why ) I think the collar was futuristic while the rich jewels were medieval. `00? ?: ( << did you buy >> ) No. I loved it but I couldn't afford it. `015 t:  Then the lace dress was gorgeous, short and modern, but Victorian too. `01b a: ( ~why ) It was chic and interesting, feminine but reserved - a good mixture. `01L t:  I thought if I could persuade Vogue to do a special feature on her clothes, we could get some for a photo shoot. `016 a: ( ~why ) Then I could get my paws on them, try some on, photograph them. `00L t:  Do you think that was a cunning idea? `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) I thought it was pretty neat. `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) You have no appreciation of my skills. `00$ t:  And maybe I could help style it or help out in some way. `00U a: ( ~why ) I love being involved in photo shoots. `01- t:  I don't think it'll be hard to persuade the boss: Marant's chic mini dresses are almost a uniform for models, and fashion editors anyway. `00Y a: ( ~why ) They seem to suit their lifestyle so well. `01M t:  My Isabel sort of bonded with Marie, the assistant in the shop, over having the same name as Isabel the designer. `015 a: ( ~why ) It's an uncommon name. They both really loved the designs too. `00@ t:  It made her feel her name was cool, not old-fashioned. `01s a: ( ~why ) She has a thing about her name not being cool. No one else is called Isabel she says. `019 t:  Is your name old-fashioned or horrible or just boring? Or is it just fine? `00& a: ( old-fashioned ) Sometimes such names come back into style. `00y a: ( ~emobored ) That's sad. `00S a: ( ~badness ) Maybe you can change it one day. `00E a: ( ~dunno ) Then you deserve it. `015 a: ( [ ~goodness ~yesanswer ] ) Good, it's best if you like your own name. `01$ t:  Simone kept taking photos of the clothes with her phone so she could send begging letters to her parents for more funds. Some hope! `00& a: ( ~why ) They are immune to her pleas for money for clothes. `00R t:  Do you wish you had more money for clothes? `00? a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, I don't think I could ever have enough. `00K a: ( ~noanswer ) That's weird. How come? `01U t:  Simone's parents get begging letters all the time - living in Paris we constantly see great clothes that we can't afford. `00* a: ( ~why ) It's the nature of being in Paris and being interns. `00? t:  But sometimes we can borrow an outfit for a special occasion. `01L a: ( ~why ) A perk of the job, clothes coming and going at the magazine and the website offices. I love living here. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `000

I'd never seen one before so I had to go inside. `00X a: ( ~why ) It was so colorful, I love bright colors. `01x t:  Lots of weird and wonderfully colorful kites and other flying things like boomerangs and frisbees. `00@ a: ( ~why ) Anything that flies through the air they sell. `01Y t:  It gave me the idea of sending one to Tom. Kites are light and pretty cheap - easy to mail. I was sure he'd have fun with it. `00N a: ( ~why ) Who doesn't love flying a kite! `01v t:  I bought a box kite, shaped as a helix designed to spin as it flies - and shipped it off to Tom. `01g a: ( ~why ) I thought it'd be more fun than a static kite that just goes up and down. `00Q a: ( [ Paris France ] ) Yes, I bought it here. `01% t:  I told him about the giant kites: wings almost like parachutes that cost hundreds of dollars. I think that got him and Ben thinking. `00^ a: ( ~why ) Kites can lift heavy loads if they are big enough. `01Z t:  Those silly guys started experimenting with building their own kites. They tied Ginger onto one and launched him into the air. `00V a: ( ~why ) They love playing tricks on each other. `01x t:  Poor Ginger was scared at first then decided it was fun and kept urging them to let him go higher. `00? a: ( ~why ) I'd guess the views were amazing and it was exciting. `01K ?: ( << be Ginger scare >> ) Of course he was scared. Imagine being adrift up there, not knowing where you'll land! `01m t:  Then the string broke and he went soaring away. Tom and Ben had to chase him for miles. `015 a: ( ~why ) They had to rescue him somehow or wait until the wind dropped. `01I t:  Luckily the end of the string got caught in a tree and they could haul him down to earth. Poor little kitten. `00U a: ( ~why ) Imagine if the tree hadn't caught him! `00U t:  That might have used up one of his nine lives! `01d a: ( ~why ) If he'd been blown over the ocean he might never have been seen again. `00q t:  ^stdstoryend ( ) `00X u: ( ^accessstory ( ~kite_story ) ) ^stdstorynext ( ) `00w u: ( ~ ) ^storyrespond ( ) `000

Most people are criminals. `019 a: ( ~why ) There are so many little laws it's easy to break some unwittingly. `01v u: ( << you go jail >> ) I don't think they'll jail me for minor crimes. Jails are already too full. `012 t:  Jaywalking is illegal in lots of cities. I jaywalk. Do you jaywalk? `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) So you are a criminal too. `00v a: ( ~noanswer ) Amazing. `01$ t:  Singing for money in Paris is illegal without a permit. I recently sang with Friz and people gave him money. Another crime of mine. `00L a: ( ~why ) Laws don't always make sense. `01S t:  Laws don't always make enough sense to bother with them or the penalties for breaking the law aren't enough to stop me. `01B a: ( ~why ) I don't agree with the law or don't care if minor things are illegal. There are too many laws. `01t t:  France has some odd laws: During the day, 70% of music on the radio must be by French artists. `01B a: ( ~why ) To keep France sounding French or to keep singers employed. Protectionism is what I'd call it. `018 t:  Do they fear their language will be diluted if they hear foreign singers? `01E a: ( ~why ) English seems to have so many useful words that have no French equivalent. Le Picnik for example. `01q t:  At what point are laws ridiculous? Is making a law for what's on the radio going a bit far? `00D a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think so too. `00I a: ( ~noanswer ) You seem very French. `01H t:  Then how about the French one that makes it illegal to kiss on the railway - they mean on the actual tracks! `01e a: ( ~why ) In case you get carried away by passion. The French are big on passion. `01J t:  If a couple lies on the railroad track and kisses - it's illegal. Who would do that anyway? Lawmakers are mad! `00~ a: ( ~why ) To make laws against things no one would do. `01N t:  Every country has its weird laws. In New Jersey it's illegal to wear a bullet-proof vest when committing a murder. `017 a: ( ~why ) Heaven knows! You should face your risks and take it like a man? `01q t:  This means you get punished more for murder if you wear a bullet-proof vest while doing it. `00+ a: ( ~why ) To planned it in advance, it wasn't a crime of passion. `01Q t:  In England, all English males over the age 14 must practice 2 hours of longbow a day, supervised by the local clergy. `01N a: ( ~why ) To make sure their skills are up to the mark ready for being summoned into battle. That'll keep them busy. `01s t:  That law made sense in the Middle Ages when it was created but it is clearly out of date now. `01v a: ( ~why ) In the Middle Ages, Britain had no standing army so it needed citizens trained to fight. `01f t:  Do you think old laws should expire by having a time limit, like copyright does? `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think it's a good idea. `01m a: ( ~noanswer ) You want to have to explicitly repeal every old law? That's a lot of work. `01o ?: ( << you think old law expire >> ) I think having expiration dates on laws is a good idea. `01F t:  It's just as well that I don't like wearing trousers cos it's illegal for women to wear trousers in Paris. `00W a: ( ~why ) It's just an old law still on the books. `00V t:  But it's quite alright to wear no pants at all! `01d a: ( ~why ) It's an old law that has fallen into disuse but is still on the books. `01W t:  The authorities can see what you're wearing via lots of CCTV cameras scattered all round Paris and the rest of the country. `012 a: ( ~why ) Well I don't think it's cos they are interested in fashion. `012 t:  They want to identify faces and clothing of those breaking the law. `01Z a: ( ~why ) So they can nail people for committing crimes. Set the police or gendarmes on them with a full description or a photo. `01w t:  Apparently the majority of French people approve the idea of video surveillance in public places. `00U a: ( ~why ) Polls have shown that is their choice. `01r t:  But debate continues with plans for more cameras being constantly proposed and then shelved. `027 a: ( ~why ) One side says cameras infringe civil liberties and lead to a Big Brother society of less freedom. The French are big on individual freedom. `011 t:  I wonder if someone specializes in spotting fake purses on camera? `01a a: ( ~why ) They are so keen on stopping counterfeiters - how far will they go? `00* t: ( ^fresh ( ~counterfeiting ) ) ^calltopic ( ~counterfeiting ) `000

" all " 014 t:  Les Halles used to be a bustling market right in the middle of Paris. `01c a: ( ~why ) It was the wholesale food market that supplied food for all of Paris. `00! t:  My father told me that Pompidou destroyed Les Halles. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Pompidou wanted it moved outside the city. `00G t:  Did you ever hear of Les Halles? `00* a: ( ~why ) I'm wondering what you already know about the place. `01c a: ( ~yesanswer ) It is pretty famous - it's been controversial forever it seems. `011 a: ( ~noanswer ) I'm surprised cos it is so famous as a planning mess. `01% t:  Pompidou replaced Les Halles market with the world's biggest underground station and modern shopping precinct, the Forum des Halles. `016 a: ( ~why ) He wanted modern prestigious buildings to make Paris important. `01p t:  Now Les Halles is being renovated again so it's a big mess. It'll take years to fix it up. `00= a: ( ~why ) It's landscaping is trashed and its shops were run-down. `00$ t:  Have you ever had a shopping area improved in your town? `00? a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did it cause chaos and actually improve things? `01c a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you - it seems to take forever and then is not that great. `015 t:  But the plans for the new Les Halles park and shopping area look cool. `01V a: ( ~why ) It's all green park with trees and flowers. The shops are still in a pit but it has a canopy to keep the rain out. `01f t:  Les Halles shops and station are underground. Another monument to the escalator. `00# a: ( ~why ) You have to go down seven floors on escalators. `01P t:  I visited it briefly to see the subterranean shopping center but it was a construction site mess and smelt horrible. `016 a: ( ~why ) Endless debates what to do with it and no action. So it decays. `01Z t:  Les Halles smells of fast food and old sewage scented with disinfectants, I thought. But experts claim there's something else. `019 a: ( [ ~why what ] ) The site has had some unpleasant uses over the centuries. `00C b: ( ~example ) A burial ground. `00~ t:  Does the smell of a place affect whether you use it? `00% a: ( ~why ) It's a fair question. How sensitive is your nose? `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. Places that smell bad or just weird are nasty. I keep away. `00$ a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you don't have a very sensitive nose. `01B t:  Les Halles tries to conceal it's smell by having lots of perfume shops in it. It works in some places. `00S a: ( ~why ) All you can smell is strong perfume. `01U t:  The old produce market did need to be rebuilt. But Pompidou was unlucky in his placement of the underground Metro center. `00I a: ( ~why ) The site was contaminated. `01# t:  Les Halles was sited on a 12th century drainage system to send slaughtered animal blood to the Seine. And after that it got worse. `011 a: ( ~why ) The land was considered toxic so it got another nasty use. `01A t:  In the Middle Ages the city dug mass graves at Les Halles and named it the Saints-Innocents cemetery. `00* a: ( ~why ) The poor were considered innocent, of wealth anyway. `01V t:  The dead poor were heaped in pits and covered in limestone to help the bodies decompose faster so more could be packed in. `018 a: ( ~why ) There were so many bodies to bury they were running out of space. `01^ t:  Nowadays, the creepiest thing is the lingering smell of lime and decay. Every metro car that opens its doors here takes in that odor. `00W a: ( ~why ) You're down at the level of the corpses. `01F t:  Anyway what with the smell, the cheap chain store shops, and its reputation for pickpockets, I left, fast. `01r a: ( ~why ) It wasn't my idea of a fun place to shop. There are plenty of alternatives in Paris. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `016 ?: ( << 'you [ do have ] Les_Halles >> ) I didn't like it there. It stinks. `000

Where are they? `00~ a: ( ~why ) Don't you think it's odd you can't see them? `00J a: ( !? there ) Well, I can't see them. `01j a: ( ~dunno ) It's because they are hidden by the light. They are too faint by contrast. `01r ?: ( << where be [ star Milky_Way_Galaxy ] >> ) I presume they're there, just obscured by light. `01T t:  People usually love light at night. It makes them feel safe. But astronomers and cats would like it to be dark at night. `00G a: ( ~why ) So we can see the stars. `01x t:  Streetlights, cars, neon signs, house lights, flood lights, searchlights. So much light pollution. `00U a: ( ~why ) People aren't comfortable in the dark. `01I t: <PARISNIGHT ( ) One of the things that makes Paris such a beautiful city is the way it's illuminated at night. `00U a: ( ~why ) It gives the city an atmospheric glow. `00# a: ( how * illuminated ) Paris has very classy streetlamps. `01T t:  The Paris streetlights are elegant creatures: lanterns, candelabras, wrought iron fantasies on lovely art-noveau stands. `01A a: ( ~why ) Back then all public works were made beautifully, as craft. We don't do that so much anymore. `01v t:  And I love the twinkling lights on the Eiffel Tower at night. So I'm as much to blame as anyone. `017 a: ( ~why ) I'm a sucker for glitter and twinkles. I like it in fashion too. `00P t:  Do you find your city beautiful at night? `01t a: ( ~why ) Because I feel conflicted about it. I love Paris at night but I want to see the stars. `00# a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you mind that you can't see the stars? `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you wish you could see more stars? `018 ?: ( << you city [ beauty pretty beautiful ] night >> ) ^reuse ( PARISNIGHT ) `01y t:  But what about the stars? We don't see them anymore. I wish we could turn the night sky dark again. `00I a: ( ~why ) I'd like to see the stars. `01* t:  Street lighting was created in the 16th century to make streets safer. Not just crime. Cobblestones or mud can be slippery in the dark. `00F a: ( ~why ) Streets weren't smooth. `01H t:  Paris was first lit by royal command and citizens were told to keep lights lit in windows facing the street. `00R a: ( ~why ) To cast some light into the street. `00% t:  Do you feel scared if you're out at night when it's dark? `00R a: ( ~why ) Many people fear being in the dark. `01m a: ( ~yesanswer ) If you're in a strange part of town it's comforting to have streetlights. `00Q a: ( ~noanswer ) You are an intrepid explorer. `01C ?: ( << you [ afraid scare ] [ night dark ] >> ) Cats have good night vision, so the dark doesn't scare us. `01U t:  In the 17th century the King ordered lights hung on ropes across the street: a tallow candle in an iron-framed glass box. `00+ a: ( ~why ) To give a little light on the roadway and reduce crime. `013 t:  Do you think a candle would give enough light to be useful at night? `00! a: ( ~yesanswer ) Maybe once your eyes were dark adapted. `00* a: ( ~noanswer ) It seems a very small flicker against the dark. `01f ?: 8CANDLE ( << candle enough light >> ) I don't think candles would be good enough. `00U ?: ( << you ~opinion candle >> ) ^reuse ( CANDLE ) `01m t:  In 1820, Paris adopted gas street lighting after seeing it used successfully in London. `01f a: ( ~why ) It was the cheapest and safest to produce. They used gas made from coal. `01w t:  The revolutionaries liked to smash the lights to allow rebels to move through the streets unseen. `00X a: ( ~why ) You can commit crimes unseen in the dark. `01O t:  The first electric street lights in 1875 were bright, glaring arc lamps on very high poles that cast a harsh light. `01g a: ( ~why ) They were only used at major junctions - too expensive to use everywhere. `01z t:  I wonder what it was like seeing the first electric streetlights after having had gentle gas lights. `01f a: ( ~why ) I wonder if I would have welcomed the brightness or complained about it. `01h t:  What are streetlights like where you live? Do you find them comforting or glaring? `00@ a: ( ~why ) I wonder what your experience of them is like. `00Z ?: ( << what streetlight like >> ) They are way bright. `00# ?: ( << [ comfort glare ] >> ) They are too bright for cats `01^ t:  Paris is called the City of Light, in part because of its early adoption of street lighting, thanks to Baron von Houseman, its mayor. `01a a: ( ~why ) They are very distinctive and give the city a lot of its character. `00T a: ( who ) The man in charge of rebuilding Paris. `01L t:  Paris is experimenting with dimming its street lights using intelligent remote management - whatever that means. `019 a: ( ~why ) They are trying to save money by turning them off when not needed. `01S t:  But that won't mean we can see the stars. It's just about saving money. Lighting uses 1/4 of all electricity worldwide. `00X a: ( ~why ) The bill for street lighting is enormous. `01l t:  The problem is that lights don't just shine down. They shine everywhere, including up. `00$ a: ( ~why ) I guess they were just easier to build that way. `01G t:  The lights of Las Vegas, Nevada, are visible 93 miles from the city. You can even see them in Death Valley. `01t a: ( ~why ) It's a super-gaudy city with massive lighting at night for all the casinos and hotels. `01W t:  I'd like to replace all the current electric street lighting with lamps made to only shine down - don't illuminate the sky. `00$ a: ( ~why ) So we could all see the night sky and the stars. `01O t:  If bulbs only shone down we could save electricity and maybe not throw off migrating birds' auto-navigation senses. `01D a: ( ~why ) Birds get confused and fly into buildings and die in their thousands because of lights at night. `01z ?: ( << light navigation >> ) Night migrating birds use the stars to navigate. City lights confuse them. `018 t:  Have you changed over to using LEDs or other energy-saving bulbs at home? `01I a: ( ~yesanswer ) I hope you're not using those compact fluorescent ones with mercury inside. We changed to LEDs. `01i a: ( ~noanswer ) Still using old incandescents then. You must enjoy big electric bills. `025 ?: ( << you [ energy-saving LED fluorescent CFL compact_fluorescent ] >> ) We use LEDs, not those nasty compact fluorescent ones with mercury inside. `01+ t:  Some parking lots that used to be lit by 1,000W mercury lights now use 168W LED shine-down lights. The sky above them is gloriously black. `016 a: ( ~why ) To save power and hence money. They also protect the night sky. `018 t:  I saw the PBS documentary "The City Dark" recently about light pollution. `017 a: ( ~why ) I was interested in this question of overly lit nighttime skies. `01G t:  It made me want to find somewhere really dark so I could see the stars. I've never even seen the Milky Way. `00# a: ( ~why ) There is too much light going up from the city. `01? t:  I haven't found anywhere with a truly dark sky yet. Maybe I should ask the people at the International Dark-Sky Association where to go. `016 a: ( ~why ) They try to convince countries to reduce their light pollution. `01& t:  Perhaps I should go to New Zealand. It has the world's largest dark sky reserve. Besides, it has great scenery and lots of dairy cows. `00V a: ( ~why ) To see what a real dark sky looks like. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01F u: ( what be * light pollution ) Light Pollution is excessive and inappropriate artificial light, aka skyglow. `00- u: ( what be * tallow candle ) It's a candle made from animal fat. `000

But when I think about it more, maybe its the right place. It's handy. `01z a: ( ~noanswer ) I think you're right. Back then transport wasn't good so living in town was convenient. `01Z t:  Nowadays, with no more royals, the palace is an art gallery, the gardens are public parks, and the market a really nasty mall. `00R a: ( ~why ) All in the name of improving Paris. `01E t:  The Louvre holds Western art from the middle ages to about 1848, at which point Musee d'Orsay takes over. `00Z a: ( ~why ) There wasn't room for it all in the Louvre. `01O t:  So for me the Louvre is mostly stuff I'm not that interested in. Dark, gloomy portraits, or overly decorated works. `00^ a: ( ~why ) I just don't like all that classic old master art. `01J t:  I prefer the more modern Musee d'Orsay or the more ancient Musee de Moyen Age with the corroded old gargoyles. `00Y a: ( ~why ) I find really ancient stuff so photogenic. `00* t:  Still, I couldn't really be in Paris and not see the Louvre. `00X a: ( ~why ) It's the biggest art museum in the world. `014 t:  I skipped the formal gardens and long walks with ponds and fountains. `00B a: ( ~why ) I find them boring. `01j t:  I chose the rue de Rivoli side where it's all bustling people and traffic and shops. `00V a: ( ~why ) I think I mentioned shops - yes, shops. `00+ t:  Which would you choose to walk through - the park or the shops? `00* a: ( [ park garden ] ) I found it dull and bland and too formal. `01b a: ( [ shop store ] ) Exciting Parisienne shops - Ok, mostly tourist shops here. `01b t:  But it's hard on the paws, the riverside building alone is half a mile long. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It was built as a fortress and used as a palace. `01C t:  I was intrigued by the outside glass pyramid. Does modern art work next to the ancient palace? It does. `01A a: ( ~why ) It gives a myriad reflections of the ancient buildings in the reflecting pool surrounding it. `01n t:  Do you like the idea of mixing modern architecture with a centuries old fortress/palace? `00# a: ( ~why ) It was very controversial when it was proposed. `01B a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's very well executed. I was surprised how much I liked it. It uses light brilliantly. `00! a: ( ~noanswer ) I understand having misgivings about it. `01l t:  The courtyard with the pyramid also works for the skateboarders who hang around there. `01p a: ( ~why ) Big flattish areas - I find the modern flat cobbles a bit bumpy for my skateboard. `01Q t:  Plus there's lots of flat smooth paths they can use in the formal gardens that run from the Tuilleries to the Louvre. `00^ a: ( ~why ) The gardens and parks are very extensive and flat. `00W t:  There wasn't any particular art I wanted to see. `00Y a: ( ~why ) It doesn't covers eras I'm interested in . `01q ?: ( << how long were you [ in inside ] >> ) I was there for an hour, mostly lost and confused. `01P t:  I strolled through to see the oldest French crown - a golden lumpy pudding stuffed with jewels. Not that attractive. `01u a: ( ~why ) I thought it might be a thing of beauty but it was just a lot of gold and lumpy jewels. `01w t:  I did find one thing I loved: the ancient Greek marble statue 'The Winged Victory of Samothrace'. `00A a: ( ~why ) She's so graceful. `01J a: ( what ) It's a lifesize statue set up on top of a flight of stairs so you walk up towards it. It's impressive. `01H t:  It's a headless, armless woman with wings perched on the prow of a boat. It's really beautiful and dramatic. `01S a: ( ~why ) Imagine a flying goddess just landed on a boat - she's meant to be Victory declaring the winner of some battle. `01y t:  It left me wondering what her head had been like and who was such a philistine they knocked it off. `00~ a: ( ~why ) Who would vandalise such a beautiful statue? `01c t:  But I suppose when you're well over two thousand years old, accidents happen. `01s a: ( ~why ) Goddesses fall from favor, get involved in wars, get moved around or made scapegoats. `00M t:  Do you know the Winged Victory statue? `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) Isn't she striking and impressive! `00* a: ( ~noanswer ) Go Google her, there are lots of images online. `01Q t:  I also went to see da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa'. It's a dull little painting with a ton of security and a zillion tourists. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's so valuable they don't want it stolen again. `00I t:  Do you like the Mona Lisa's smile? `00P a: ( ~why ) Not everyone thinks it's a smile. `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Having seen it live I'm not so keen anymore. `00U a: ( ~noanswer ) It's kinda wishy washy, isn't it. `01i t:  Some psychologists examined her face and say they are somewhat sure she is smiling. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Enigmatic is the word for that expression. `01v t:  Very Parisienne to look vaguely pleasant but for others to not be sure if you're really smiling. `013 a: ( ~why ) Parisiennes think you are stupid if you smile for no reason. `01T t:  I took a peek at the posh underground shopping center. The shops were small and quite nice in a rich tourist fodder way. `01a a: ( ~why ) They sell things to do with the Louvre - rich trifles and luxuries. `01i a: ( << you [ buy purchase ] >> ) No. Nothing I needed and at prices I couldn't afford. `01D t:  The Louvre is all very rich and magnificent, but I soon felt numb with marble and glitter and gold leaf. `01A a: ( ~why ) It's too decorative and the display seems meaningless. It's not like it was ever a real home. `01A t:  It's more of that Versailles thing. It's just too big. You need a skateboard or Segway to get around. `00W a: ( ~why ) Miles of marble corridors and ballrooms. `01b t:  Do you think it was a waste of money building a huge palace like the Louvre? `01C a: ( ~why ) I'm curious if you think it was cool or excessive. Like in the film "The Queen of Versailles" . `012 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, I can't even see how it worked as a fortress. `022 a: ( ~noanswer ) You'd like the film "The Queen of Versailles" - a couple spends $100m to build a 90,000 square foot house modelled on Versailles. `01I t:  I prefer my palaces more like Disney's: white, with turrets, and fireworks. The Louvre architecture bores me. `015 a: ( ~why ) It was built as a fortress so it's rather long and repetitive. `01H t:  I think the kings of France were stupid: spending all their money on glitz while their people were starving. `00Z a: ( ~why ) It did no one any good and got them killed. `00& t:  No wonder they ended up with a revolution and a guillotine. `013 a: ( ~why ) Dictators fall when their people get fed up and want change. `01x t:  Kings and dictators always repeat the same mistakes. It's just like in the Middle East these days. `01$ a: ( ~why ) Rulers think they can get away with any abuse of their people - until there's a revolution. And they fall. Like Ozymandias. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01w ?: ( << 'you [ do have ] Louvre >> ) I've visited it, but I'm not impressed. Not my fave kind of art. `00G a: ( why ) I prefer more modern art. `015 ?: ( << did you visit Louvre >> ) Of course. But I prefer more modern art. `01= ?: ( what be Ozymandias ) It's from a famous poem by Shelley: "My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" `000

Multi-colored things that look like rainbow colored Oreos. `01h a: ( ~why ) They are small and look delicate like they couldn't possibly be fattening. `01X t:  Don't confuse macarons with macaroons: a chewy mound of shredded coconut, lightly sweetened and held together by egg whites. `017 a: ( ~why ) The names sound similar but the actual cakes are very different. `01- t:  Macarons are meringue with butter-cream filling. Chewy and too sweet for me: they cling to my teeth as if they plan on rotting them away. `00= a: ( ~why ) I'm not a sugar addict. And I love my sharp white teeth. `00y t:  Have you eaten macarons? `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you like them? `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) You should at least try one. `01G t:  They are crazy popular in Paris. The Laduree pastry shops have been known for macarons for about 150 years. `00+ a: ( ~why ) It's one of the things they bake that are very popular. `01N t:  In France, McDonald's sells macarons in their McCafes, sometimes comparing the shape of it to that of a hamburger. `00U a: ( ~why ) They do look like tiny pretty burgies. `00# t:  Macarons are like drugs for Parisienne women on a diet. `00@ a: ( ~why ) They can't resist the combo of sugar and chic. `01@ t:  Parisienne women get around their diets by buying macarons for their friends at get-togethers, then being offered one themselves. `01l a: ( ~why ) They are being generous and sociable - so much virtue associated with a treat. `01r t:  It's a clever little trick, like buying your friends chocolates in hopes of being given one. `01b a: ( ~why ) It's such a nice way of getting a chocolate but not eating too many. `00% t:  But I'll stop talking about them - they're too fattening. `00S a: ( ~why ) I want to talk about something else. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01N ?: ( << [ big size ] macaron >> ) Maybe like a 2 inch square.

Next the aristocrats built mansions and moved in. `01J a: ( ~why ) In the 1960's it was declared a historic district and a slow process of cleaning and renovation began. `010 t:  Nowadays it's the place to go for live music and some adventures. `01~ a: ( ~why ) It became rundown when the rich moved to St Germain. So cheap rents attracted poor artists and musicians to live there. `01O t:  It's also the oldest and most medieval part of Paris - the streets are narrow and the buildings ancient. I love it. `01d a: ( ~why ) It feels like going back in time. It's so bustling and full of action. `00Z t:  Do you have somewhere in your town like the Marais? `01a a: ( ~yesanswer ) The good clubs are generally in out of the way parts of town. `01c a: ( ~noanswer ) Too bad, it's good to have somewhere a bit different to explore. `01B t:  Luckily, I've made a friend who lives there so I can go out there at night and stay over at her place. `01E a: ( ~why ) It's safer to go out with a friend and even more so if I don't have to travel so far to get home. `00u a: ( who ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01u t:  Elise is a cool cat and a photography student - we met as we both like playing music with Friz. `00+ a: ( ~why ) It's nice to come out from behind the camera sometimes. `01p a: ( who ) Friz is a friend of mine - I'm in a busking band with him and Elise and two others. `00D t:  Do you have many cat friends? `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think Felis fabulatus make good friends. `01b a: ( ~noanswer ) That's sad, are you one of those people who are allergic to us? `01i t:  Elise loves living in the Marais. It's good to have a French feline friend, my FFF. `01P a: ( ~why ) We can hang out and groom peacefully chatting about photography. She's on my wavelength. And she loves fish. `00V t:  We go exploring together, cameras at the ready. `01w a: ( ~why ) We both love photography. She likes contrast of old and modern. I like the ancient ruins. `01A t:  Her studio apartment is right at the top of a six story building that dates back to the 13th century. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It was cheap and she didn't mind the stairs. `01M t:  Elise says her house has cellars that connect up to secret passages. But I've had enough of sewers and Catacombs. `01w a: ( ~why ) I didn't like being under the ground when I toured the Catacombs and the sewers had rats. `00! t:  Can you imagine living any place eight centuries old? `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) I thought only cathedrals could be that old. `01U a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either, anything two centuries old is ancient to me. Living in a house that's 8 centuries old is bizarre. `01E t:  I went up the old wooden twisty stairs gawking at the massive wooden beams sticking out from the plaster. `01C a: ( ~why ) The house was built on a timber frame then filled with stone rubble and plastered over the top. `01d t:  The ceilings in her studio are low and strangely bent but that is fine for me. `00A a: ( ~why ) I'm not that tall. `01b t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) We had a bit of an adventure one night.

It had to be back the next day and I needed to be really careful with it. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It was going to be used for a fashion shoot. `00# t:  I met up with Elise at her place and we both got ready. `00- a: ( ~why ) I didn't want to wear the dress until the last minute. `01E t:  The event wasn't going to start til at least 9pm. Plenty of time to work on her look and admire my dress. `01~ a: ( ~why ) She needed help with dressing up. I taught her my scarf knotting trick to make a headdress so she'd look a bit African. `01j t:  Elise's place was just a long block and a twist away from where the party was to be. `00L a: ( ~why ) They were both in the Marais. `01g t:  The band was drumming up a storm, the place was packed with fashion world people. `00J a: ( ~why ) The word had gotten around. `01M t:  The little Senegalese delicacies were fast disappearing and the drink was flowing as only an open bar can induce. `00@ a: ( ~why ) The French love free booze, as do most people. `01t t:  I'd been persuaded to try a glass of champagne. The bubbles were just as odd as I'd been told. `014 a: ( ~why ) They went up my nose and clung to my whiskers. It felt weird. `00- t:  It really didn't taste that great, but Elise and I drank some. `01d a: ( ~why ) I wanted to try it and she said she rarely got offered free champagne. `01v t:  Elise got her camera out and dared me to pose outlandishly for her.

Grand Central Station in NY is an awesome place. Paris has a lot of stations as it's the hub for much of Europe. `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) Really? But they are so beautiful and atmospheric. `01S t:  D'Orsay was used as a station for forty years but then got abandoned as its platforms were too short for modern trains. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It made it hard for people to get off the train. `01p t:  French trains are short. They should try American freight trains. They can be a mile long. `01& a: ( ~why ) America is huge and flat, so trains can be longer. They travel slowly with hundreds of wagons being pulled by several engines. `01y t:  Get stuck at a crossing with one of those babies and you get to see a lot of flatcars and graffiti. `01h a: ( ~why ) They move slowly so you get to count all the cars as they trudge past you. `01d ?: ( what be flatcar ) It's a car that just a flat platform for stacking goods on. `01f t:  Have you ever been stuck at a railway crossing waiting for a long train to pass? `00Z a: ( ~why ) It's a time you notice things about trains. `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) Tedious isn't it. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) Don't you have any trains where you live? `01k t:  The museum was left to become a ruin - I'd have loved to photograph it in those days. `00Q a: ( ~why ) I adore photographing urban ruins. `01B t:  Apparently it was such a great ruin that Orson Welles filmed some Kafka drama inside it way back when. `00X a: ( ~why ) He loved the atmosphere of the place too. `00# t:  Do you think there's something attractive about a ruin? `01W a: ( ~yesanswer ) Like old castles and churches and monasteries you can have modern ruins like warehouses and railway stations. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) You like your world clean and tidy do you? `01s t:  After the destruction of Les Halles in the 80's Paris started appreciating its old buildings. `01a a: ( ~why ) It realized they would all be destroyed unless they were protected. `018 t:  D'Orsay got turned into an art place. Nowadays it's ridiculously popular. `01t a: ( ~why ) People didn't want to see the old station demolished - it's so beautiful and historic. `01P t:  It's almost always packed, especially the attic space where the most popular art is crammed in - not a great design. `00D a: ( ~why ) It gets hot up there. `01q t:  I love this quirky museum. It's really near home, just round the corner from our apartment. `01t a: ( ~why ) It was setup to take the load off the Louvre which had more art than it could display. `01L t:  I like the wall with Monet's Rouen cathedral paintings, each the same but done under different light conditions. `01j a: ( ~why ) A place looks different in full sun, in rain, at dusk - just think about it. `00= t:  I know how important lighting is to the atmosphere of my photos. `013 a: ( ~why ) I take a lot of photographs, often in dim or weird lighting. `01C t:  They have some Klimt's, one of my fave artists. Plus some amazing Rodin sculptures out on the terraces. `00& a: ( ~why ) I love Klimt and Rodin, its great to go visit them. `01y t:  It's way too much to take it all in at once.

I just love it. `01f a: ( << what original use >> ) Using the restaurant for a fashion show during meals. `01b t:  Vogue created their "Gathering of young designers" to help them get started. `01t a: ( ~why ) It's something they do in each country to keep the fashion world fresh with new blood. `010 t:  One of the new designers needed somewhere to show his collection. `01d a: ( ~why ) It's hard affording an attractive venue when you're just starting out. `00- t:  I suggested having models walk amongst diners in a restaurant. `01f a: ( ~why ) It's a no-pressure way to see a show - a bit like a cabaret performance. `01i t:  People get to see the clothes from all angles while enjoying a drink and some food. `01P a: ( ~why ) The models come close so you can appreciate the details of the clothes. The lunch is the excuse to be there. `00G t:  Do you think this idea was nuts? `00S a: ( ~why ) You can critique it if you think so. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) Ha, well it worked for me. `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly. It was a fine idea. `01o t:  Vogue told me to organise the designer showing.

Now he's been noticed and gotten in the magazine and on the website. `01K t:  The museum showed its appreciation to me: I got a Carte Blanche - free access for the rest of my time in Paris. `01G a: ( ~why ) They hope to do more collaborations like that in future.

It's name means Our Lady. `01@ ?: ( what be Ile_de_la_Citie ) It means the island of the city - it's the oldest part of Paris: where the first settlement was sited. `01P ?: ( << biggest cathedral >> ) Notre Dame is the biggest cathedral in Paris. ? What cathedral did you like best in paris `01w ?: ( << [ what which ] cathedral you ~like >> ) I like the classic gothic architecture of Notre Dame. `01A ?: ( << where Notre_Dame >> ) Notre Dame sits upon Ile de la Citie - "island of the city" - in the Seine. `01O ?: ( << when organ Notre_Dame >> ) There have been organs in Notre Dame since it was built back in the eleven hundreds. `01J ?: ( << how often organ [ repair replace ] >> ) The cathedral seems to need a new organ about every hundred years. `01h ?: ( << how many pipes >> ) This one was made in the 19th century and has 7,800 pipes. `01Y ?: :ORGANIST ( << [ what who ] be organist >> ) There are three tenured or resident organists plus guest performers most Sundays. `00U ?: ( << how many organist >> ) ^reuse ( ORGANIST ) `01V ?: ( << what there [ before previously ] >> ) A Roman temple to Jupiter stood on the muddy island before Notre Dame was built. `02d ?: ( << when [ cathedral Notre_Dame ] [ build complete finish ] >> ) It was started in 1160 and completed about 1345, if a cathedral is ever really finished. `01Y ?: ( << [ someone anyone king anybody ] [ crown coronation ] >> ) Napoleon liked the cathedral enough to be crowned there in 1804 `01$ ?: ( << Notre_Dame restore >> ) The place got restored in the 1820s due to Victor Hugo's fundraising and his novel Notre Dame de Paris. `01y ?: ( << who [ renovation renovate ] >> ) The architect Viollet-le-Duc was in charge of the renovations. `01B ?: ( << old statue >> ) The old statues were at taken to the Musee du Moyen Age so you can still see them. `01* ?: ( << you [ ~like favorite ] statue >> ) I like Viollet's final statue, one of himself among the angels on the roof, looking heavenwards. `01i ?: ( << what be in crypt >> ) In the crypt are the remains of Roman life on the island. `010 ?: ( << 'you [ do have ] Notre_Dame >> ) I loved the gargoyles there. `00X u: ( ^accessstory ( ~notre_dame ) ) ^stdstorynext ( ) `00w u: ( ~ ) ^storyrespond ( ) `000

" all " 00P t: ( ^stdblock ( $noordering ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `01C t: 9OVERLAP ( ) Having found a great cafe or restaurant, you then have to master the next hurdle. Ordering. `01n a: ( ~why ) If you order poorly, you may not get what you expected. So ordering gets tricky. `01z ?: ( << understand English >> ) They may or may not understand English, and they may pretend they don't. `01s t:  French waiters take great pleasure in delivering you what you ask for, but not what you want. `00# a: ( ~why ) It's their little revenge on the world I think. `01? a: ( what * mean ) I mean they take great glee in messing with your mind and increasing their tip by giving you too much of what you wanted. `00Z ?: ( what do you * do ) I learned magic waiter phrases. `00? ?: ( << what you order today >> ) I've ordered coffee with cream. `01z u: ( << you can not order in English >> ) You can try. But that's worse than ordering wrongly in French. `01S a: ( ~why ) They can pretend they don't understand you at all, or they can do what they want and claim it's what you meant. `01N u: ( << wrong stuff on purpose >> ) If they can find a way to misconstrue your request, they will. So it's deliberate. `01B t:  I got to be friends with the waiter here, and having messed up several times, he explained a few tips. `01x a: ( ~why ) If I'm to be a regular of his he wants me to be a happy customer - then I'll tip better... `00v a: ( what ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01e ?: ( << you order properly >> ) Yes, I can order most anything and get what I want. `019 ?: ( << you bad at ordering >> ) I used to be bad at ordering. I'm better now. `01q t:  You must use the same language as waiters if you want them to bring you the correct things. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Or your order is open to misunderstanding. `01h a: ( << what language >> ) It's a language of special phrases that waiters understand. `00? a: ( [ what ~example ] ) Coffee, water, anything you might order. `014 a: ( French ) Speaking French is only part of it. It's all in the idioms. `01- t:  Don't ask for water - "de l'eau" - or they'll sell you bottled mineral water. "une carafe d'eau" - is tap water not in a sealable bottle. `025 a: ( ~why ) That means a carafe of tap water. The French are very mean with their tap water so order a carafe then you'll get enough to fill a glass. `01F t:  If you want a glass of beer, you must order "un demi" , not "une biere" , lest you get a two liter flagon. `00Y a: ( ~why ) That is the default delivery and it's big! `01^ t:  For a normal cup of coffee ask for "un creme" . "Un cafe au lait" - coffee with milk - is wrong and produces a huge bucket of coffee. `01G a: ( ~why ) That's just the way it gets interpreted. Languages are not a precise tool - certainly French isn't. `01Z t:  For an espresso, order "un express" . An espresso with a bit of milk is "une noisette" . A weak black coffee is "un allonge" . `01D a: ( ~why ) It strictly means a long coffee but it is understood to mean coffee made longer by adding water. `01T t:  In France, waiters go out of their way to give you too much. In America, customers request it by saying "supersize it" . `00T a: ( ~why ) Large portions are popular in the US. `00M t:  Either way, people often get too much. `00v a: ( ~why ) For a change. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01^ u: ( << you order dictionary >> ) A dictionary will not tell you the nuances you want. Looking up "water" will not ask for what you want. `000

Siblings are always fighting and arguing. `01H t:  Whoever claims the other 'started it' - you have to punish both or one will get away with verbal incitement. `01R a: ( ~why ) It's easy to say that it's the physical fighter who is to blame rather than the one who incited them to fight. `00V t:  Did you get in fights with your siblings a kid? `00= a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, with cousins of mine when they visited us. `00P b: ( ~why ) I wasn't good at sharing I think. `00M a: ( ~noanswer ) You were a perfect child. `01C t:  But kids will whine and say it's not fair. Still the parents must stick to their guns. Mine always did. `01a a: ( ~why ) Backing down means kids learn that what parents say doesn't matter. `01- t:  I've read that parents hate to be the bad guy. They want to be loved, or even to be your friend, so they don't really want to punish you. `00# a: ( ~why ) It makes them feel you won't love them anymore. `00H t:  Did your parents ever punish you? `01f a: ( ~yesanswer ) What did they do? Mine sent me to my room or stopped my allowance. `00~ a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you are part of the problem then. `01= ?: ( << you punish kitten >> ) I think my punishments were the clean-up sessions after I'd gotten into the decorating materials.

Parents who won't punish their kids at home don't want teachers doing it either. `01e a: ( ~why ) They fear their kids will hate them for sending them to a harsh school. `00V t:  What sort of punishments did you get at school? `00z a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know. `01N t: ;DETENTION ( ) I had some detentions and once got sent to the principle for arguing with my teacher too forcefully. `01B a: ( ~why ) I thought there were holes in her argument so I pushed for my viewpoint. She didn't like that. `01V t:  Is it all about discipline? No. It's also about love. And one thing kids love to remember years later is parent's stories. `00R a: ( ~why ) It's a close and shared experience. `01= t:  Tell or read bedtime stories.

Ugh! I'm breathing that stuff! `01N a: ( ~why ) I want to be here but the thought of how bad the air is some days worries me. Am I using up my ninth life? `01L a: ( << how [ conclude decide measure determine ] >> ) Beats me. Some government study using statistics one assumes. `01V t:  I thought the air pollution came from all the cigarettes the French smoke. But they say road transport is the main source. `01C a: ( ~why ) Nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, fine particles in diesel smoke - they all come from vehicles. `018 t:  Do you drive or travel in a polluting car or an electric one or a hybrid? `00+ a: ( [ not_drive not_travel ] ) Ah, that's a solution to pollution. `01d a: ( [ ordinary regular combustion pollute ] ) One day they will be extinct, good. `00V a: ( electric ) They are getting better and better. `00M a: ( hybrid ) Better than nothing I guess. `00Y a: ( [ none not no ] ) Excellent if you can manage it. `00J a: ( alternative ) Ooh how interesting. `02O ?: ( << you [ ride drive travel go use ] [ pollute regular standard normal gasoline combustion electric hybrid ~car ] >> ) I love the little electric cars they have in Paris, but usually I bike. `01$ t:  Paris is trying to improve air quality. In 2011, they banned old diesel cars, 4X4s and trucks. I wish they'd do that in the States. `00W a: ( ~why ) The air in the US needs cleaning up too. `01y t:  Before I arrived, the air got really bad from heavy particles. The government was asked to step in. `00$ a: ( ~why ) They can do things faster than local government. `01R t:  So they cut the speed cars could travel by 20kph on the Paris ringroad and told people to be vigilant. Not a big help. `00O a: ( ~why ) Marginal reduction in emissions. `00^ t:  What would you have done to fix the air quality emergency? `00U a: ( ban * truck ) For a few days that might help. `00U a: ( ban * [ drive car ] ) Nice desperate measure. `01y a: ( close * [ plant manufacture factory industry ] ) Puts people out of work but temporarily possible. `00p a: ( fan ) Love it. `00- a: ( [ leave go evacuate elsewhere ] ) An emergency holiday, cool. `01$ ?: ( << [ what how ] you [ fix handle deal ] >> ) They should build a bunch of wind turbines that can be reversed to be fans on demand. `01? t:  Airparif blamed the weather - little wind and high pressure, keeping pollution close to the ground. Same thing that happens in LA or SF. `01X a: ( ~why ) When the air is still the toxins build up. Normally the wind spreads them around and stirs them into the upper airs. `01* ?: ( what be Airparif ) It's an organisation responsible for monitoring the air quality in the Paris agglomeration. It was founded in 1979. `01C t:  Paris is constructing more eco-friendly public transport and hoping to reduce cars on the city's roads. `00R a: ( ~why ) Less cars mean less pollution.

Would our modern-day habits gel? `00O a: ( << was OK >> ) Yes, it worked out fine. `00- a: ( << how turn out >> ) It turned out great.

Luckily it wasn't far. `00E a: ( taxi ) I was saving my money. `00Z a: ( ~why ) I was tired and hot and my bags were heavy. `01U t:  The apartment is in an odd building, with a round tower and a courtyard, set near the junction with Rue de l'Universitie. `01b a: ( ~why ) I'm just telling you that so you know where it is. Go streetview it. `01v t:  The apartment was easy to find amidst the flat-fronted Paris six-storey buildings all around it. `01k a: ( ~why ) A lot of Paris was built of identical apartment buildings back in the 1850's. `00V t:  Have you ever looked at a street-view of Paris? `00V a: ( ~why ) It's a neat way to experience the city. `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) So you've seen the solid facade of buildings. `01X a: ( ~noanswer ) Go check it out. Solid stone up to the edge of the pavement in most places. The gardens are hidden at the back. `01b t:  I lugged my stuff up to the third floor - no elevator. It's common in Paris. `019 a: ( ~why ) I guess they didn't have them in the 1850s - not even in New York! `00X t:  How would you like that? So many stairs to climb. `00F a: ( ~why ) You would fly upstairs? `01e a: ( ~badness ) It's really bad when you have a lot of stuff to move and are tired. `01s a: ( ~exercise ) Ha, well it's not always convenient to have to exercise with a load of shopping. `01m t:  Colette, Isabel, and Simone were all there to greet me.

The French word for new person means "dangerous stranger" . `00X ?: ( << are your age >> ) They are all around my age. `01O t:  You'd have thought I was a serial killer coming to live with her the way Colette looked at me - such a solemn face. `017 a: ( ~why ) She was being a typical Parisienne - solemn until she knows you. `01? t:  Colette is Parisienne so she has some attitudes which come over as stuck-up. She's interning at the magazine itself. We are all envious. `020 a: 9ENVIOUS ( ~why ) She gets to see the important visitors and the most beautiful clothes. Plus it's a beautiful building. And a bit nearer us. `00D a: ( envious ) ^reuse ( ENVIOUS ) `00% t:  Would you be envious of someone with a job in Vogue's HQ? `00Y a: ( ~why ) It's a cool and prestigious place to work. `00B a: ( ~yesanswer ) Just like me. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) You don't care for fashion, I understand. `01X t:  Simone works as an editorial assistant and moves between the magazine and the website offices bringing all the juicy gossip. `01j a: ( ~why ) We always want to know who's visiting and what special events are happening. `01P t:  Simone was a bit kinder - she comes from Calais and has always known a lot of English people so she did smile a bit. `00= a: ( ~why ) She knows it makes foreign people feel more comfortable. `01k t:  Don't you think it's easier to relate to people who share the same customs as you do? `00P a: ( ~why ) There are less misunderstandings. `00S a: ( ~yesanswer ) We share the same assumptions. `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) You like some exoticness in your life. `01Y t:  Isabel is English - she's geeky and arty. She's doing computer graphics stuff for the Vogue websites both English and French. `00# a: ( ~why ) She speaks computer so she's needed everywhere. `01A t:  Isabel was lovely, gave me a welcoming grin and really helped me out by explaining what was going on. `00M a: ( ~why ) She'd been through it herself. `00I a: ( what was going on ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01= t:  Isabel said she'd had the same problem when she arrived. She thought the French all hated her and she used to cry herself to sleep over it. `010 a: ( ~why ) She didn't understand and thought it was personal to her. `01J t:  Then she found a book: "French or Foe" by Polly Platt, which explained the cultural differences of the French. `00? a: ( ~why ) It was by someone who'd understood what was going on. `01B a: ( what * [ happening going_on ] ) The French were just being themselves: different from everybody else. `01h t:  Isabel lent it to me and I read it immediately. But it was a lot to take on board. `01e a: ( ~why ) So many different customs to learn. I felt more like an anthropologist. `01X t:  Like me my flatmates are all here for the summer although they can each stay as long as they like in Paris - no visa issues. `01t a: ( ~why ) It's much harder coming from the US. I don't think the French think much to Americans. `01^ t:  Anyway - the apartment. I was stunned at how beautiful it was. Tall French windows, white shutters, opening onto tiny iron balconies. `00W a: ( ~why ) It's the French style in many buildings. `01P t:  The windows look great but the traffic noise means we never open them. No chance of Tom courting outside this house. `00T a: ( ~why ) I couldn't hear him over the traffic. `01o ?: ( how * air ) There are windows we can open facing the courtyard at the back of the house. `00! t:  I was missing Tom already and I'd only just left him. `00Z a: ( ~why ) I love him and I won't see him for a while. `01i t:  Wouldn't you miss your loved ones if you had to move away from them for six months? `00# a: ( ~why ) You could only keep in touch by phone or email. `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Of course you would. That's what I was like. `00I a: ( ~noanswer ) You are hard-hearted. `01% t:  It's pretty spacious in the apartment: five bedrooms for four of us, one being a spare for all the visiting editors that crash here. `017 a: ( ~why ) The Paris fashion shows attract editors from all over the world. `01E t:  But really we usually get turfed out onto trundle beds or the sofas when some visiting big-wigs are here. `00% a: ( ~why ) They demand all the comfy beds and private rooms. `00N t:  Do you ever lose your bed for visitors? `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) How rotten for you. Unless you like camping. `00! a: ( ~noanswer ) No visitors or a home with a guest room? `01P t:  The apartment is in a traditional 19th century building with lovely proportions and mouldings, and real wood floors. `00~ a: ( ~why ) They believed in building to last back then. `01D t:  There are only two bathrooms and no washing machine so there's always laundry dripping in the bathrooms. `00- a: ( ~why ) We have to wash stuff by hand or go to the laundrette. `01B t:  It's got no dishwasher and just a small kitchen. Could you live with no dishwasher or washing machine? `01+ a: ( ~why ) It means doing dishes and laundry by hand - damp paws ugh! They didn't seem to care about kitchens and bathrooms back then. Weird. `01% a: ( ~yesanswer ) I adapted, I don't use many dishes as I don't cook. Mostly I wash stuff by hand, which is better for delicate clothes. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) You'd have hated it in our apartment then. `00Y t:  But the living room is huge - perfect for parties. `00X a: ( ~why ) Space equals more people equals more fun. `01% t:  We have "Une soiree posee" - a quiet party with drinks and munchies or "La grosse soiree" - a party with lots of people and dancing. `00& a: ( ~why ) The French have conventions for each sort of party. `011 a: ( when ) Most weeks, usually at the weekend or on a Friday evening. `01Z t:  We have both sorts of parties. Most Parisiennes seem to fear the mess of visitors in their homes but they love coming to ours. `011 a: ( ~why ) Doesn't everyone like going to parties? We throw fun ones. `00K t:  Do you throw parties where you live? `018 a: ( ~why ) Parties are fun. Best way to insure going to one is to throw one. `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) Next time you have one, be sure to invite me. `00B a: ( ~noanswer ) Sounds boring. `01D t:  Parties are fun but the cleaning up afterwards afterwards isn't so great. How do you feel after a party? `00= a: ( ~why ) If you feel bad you may not bother with anymore of them. `00U a: ( hang_over ) LOL, so you just live in squalor? `00! a: ( hate * clean ) But you do it or hire a maid service? `00U a: ( ) Exactly. You just have to clean up. Us too. `01U t:  The apartment is only a couple of blocks from the Seine. More importantly it's walking distance from either Vogue office. `01m a: ( ~why ) It makes it easy to get to work. Public transport is crowded during rush-hours. `00~ t:  The walk to work is one of the nicest I can imagine. `00% a: ( ~why ) Whichever route I take is lovely and interesting. `01T t:  To get to work I cross the river, walk among haute couture shops, see parks, and explore a maze of ancient side streets. `00$ a: ( ~why ) There are several alternative routes I can take. `00= t:  Walking to work is so un-American. Have you ever walked to work? `01a a: ( ~why ) It seems to be unpopular to put the effort back into everyday life. `01w a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's quite a nice start to the day if you're not late. I pick up a coffee en route. `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) So you drive or take public transport? `00R a: ( [ where coffee ] ) Couture Cafe of course. `017 t:  It's great living right in the center of Paris and so near to the river. `01K a: ( ~why ) I can walk or cycle to most of the famous sights of Paris. All that romance just outside my front door. `01A t:  The neighborhood is St Germain. It's in the sixth arrondissement. It's very ritzy and mega expensive. `020 a: ( ~why ) It used to be a hangout for writers and intellectuals but now it's full of prestige for times past and the famous who are long gone. `01q t:  I'm glad I have a subsidized apartment with my parents covering what rent I do have to pay. `00^ a: ( ~why ) I could never afford to live round here otherwise. `01= t:  St Germain is next to the Latin quarter. No, it's not full of Hispanics! It's named for the Latin spoken at the universities located there. `013 a: ( ~why ) Some of the earliest universities in the world are in Paris. `01v a: ( [ why university student Paris ] ) It's a very ancient and important city where all roads meet. `01^ t:  There are lots of students in the Latin quarter. That makes for cheap food available whenever we need it. It's a great place to live. `00@ a: ( ~why ) Lots of action and yet affordable food - good. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01z ?: ( << how you [ choose pick ] apartment >> ) It's one that Vogue has for interns and visiting editors. `01n ?: ( << you ~like the apartment >> ) It's a wonderful apartment.

But the color tells everyone in Paris how the air is. `016 t:  What do you think to the balloon idea?

Too much other work to do and things to see. `01l s: ( << 'I [ not hate ] coffee >> ) $nocoffeetalk = 1 ^stddrop ( "OK. No talk of cafes." ) `01D t:  There are ten thousand cafes - maybe it should be called "City of Caffeine" instead of "City of Light" . `01F a: ( << ~why [ city_of_light light ] >> ) It has so many lights on at night and historic looking street lamps. `00^ a: ( ~why ) Coffee is the stimulant of choice for Parisiennes. `010 ?: ( << how many cafe you [ visit try ] >> ) I've maybe tried out 50. `00~ ?: ( << fond of tea >> ) Tea is not so popular in Paris. `01E ?: ( << some good cafe in Paris >> ) Of course there are some good ones. Here at Cafe Couture is one of them. `01n ?: ( << more cafe Paris than >> ) It sure seems like there are more in Paris than elsewhere. `00U t:  Do you think of cafes when you think of Paris? `00# a: ( ~why ) I wonder what associations you have with Paris. `01o a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, sitting like this in a sidewalk cafe was my dream of life in Paris. `00P a: ( ~noanswer ) What does Paris mean to you? `01^ t:  The cafes share 2.2 million Parisiennes although maybe some don't drink coffee and are there for "l'apero" , the drink before dinner. `01R a: ( ~why ) Cafes sell alcohol as well as coffee. "L'apero" is a French tradition - an aperitif to improve one's appetite. `00~ a: :COCKTAIL ( what be ) It's what we'd call a cocktail. `00& a: ( ?

It tastes vile since they don't use boiling water. `01S b: ( ~why ) They can't be bothered or don't know that it matters - similar, only tea drinkers know how to make it it seems. `00Z a: ( wine ) Watch the prices, some cafes are expensive. `01~ a: ( [ soft_drink soda water San_Pe San_Pé cola ] ) It's so refreshing to sit and drink an Orangina or a fizzy water on a hot day. `01R a: ( liquor ) Pernod and Ricard are very popular in Paris. Cocktails are becoming hugely popular - more popular than wine! `01F t:  Some cafes sell tobacco. Some sell lottery tickets. And some encourage writers to debate and philosophize. `018 a: ( ~why ) The French love to debate. It's part of their national character. `014 t:  Did you expect there to be so many different sorts of cafes in Paris? `00& a: ( ~why ) I was surprised they had so many specialized kinds. `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) Ah, well, I was surprised. `00Z a: ( ~dunno ) It's a different way of living over here. `017 a: ( << [ not no ~noanswer ] [ expect expectations ] >> ) Well now you know. `017 a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly! I thought it was cool how important the cafes are. `01& t:  There is a new sort of cafe springing up, drink-and-shop cafes, for people who can't shop for books or clothes without a caffeine fix. `00! a: ( ~why ) They always look for a new way to make money. `01u t:  They are inside department stores, bookstores, even Emporio Armani, and Lanvin's fashion house. `01J a: ( ~why ) Why let customers leave your store just to get a coffee? Keeping customers happy is good for business. `00G t:  Do you like cafes inside stores? `00W a: ( ~why ) I enjoy them. I wondered if you did too. `00@ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too.

The owners showed me what to look for in decent coffee. `00* a: ( ~why ) So I would appreciate the stuff they sell I suppose. `00z a: ( what ) Mostly the smell. `01Y t:  They laughingly gave me what they call cat's tongue cookies. I must admit that my tongue likes to be dipped in chocolate too. `00G a: ( ~why ) I love eating chocolate. `011 t:  But the coffee is incidental to the reason for existence of cafes. `00% a: ( ~why ) Cafes are such a good spot to hang-out and relax. `01T t:  The cafe is where life and contact happens. Sit, people watch, do business, entertain, write letters, surf the web, etc. `00- a: ( ~why ) There's no pressure to do anything but enjoy yourself. `01= t: 6DOIS ( ) My favourite French photographer, Robert Doisneau, took some iconic images of Parisienne cafe life.

" all " 00U t: ( ^stdblock ( $noparis_driving ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `01g t:  Driving in Paris is a nightmare. Just observing drivers as a pedestrian is scary. `00^ a: ( ~why ) The drivers are always in a hurry and are so rude. `011 t:  Do you have negative ideas about what it's like to drive in Paris? `010 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Even in the US we hear stories about Paris drivers. `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) Well let me tell you about them then. `00* t:  Parisiennes are aggressive drivers and get worked up easily. `015 a: ( ~why ) They think their mission is more important than anyone else's. `01% t:  Parisienne drivers will ignore who has right of way, block intersections, speed, and turn right or left from the very opposite lane. `00L a: ( ~why ) They do things their own way. `01L t:  They'll reverse out of a blocked street, go onto the sidewalk or even drive the wrong way down a one-way street. `00G a: ( ~why ) They hate to be delayed. `01A t:  On the positive side Parisienne drivers do have quick reactions, think fast and have nerves of steel. `018 a: ( ~why ) They need to be fast with so much unpredictable driving going on. `00Y t:  How would you feel about driving like Parisiennes? `00K a: ( madmen ) Me too, it's so dangerous. `00O a: ( ~goodness ) You must love your freedom. `00S a: ( ~badness ) You don't understand the French. `00G a: ( ~dunno ) It is baffling I know. `01T t:  I suggest forgetting using a car in Paris and use public transportation, a taxi, bicycle or your feet. That's what I do. `01b a: ( ~why ) It's a good city for walking and public transport is fast and cheap. `01Z t:  Drivers on the Champs-Elysees seem to think they're on a race track - they delight in rushing at me as I try to cross. Demons! `01% a: ( ~why ) It's a long straight wide road, I think drivers love to speed along it. Pedestrians are just a nuisance on their race track. `01- t:  If you do drive in Paris, use GPS. It's hard to understand the street layout. It's been remodelled so many times it feels all tangled up. `01v a: ( ~why ) Every prefect and mayor of Paris tries to improve the streets - but they just get worse. `01h b: ( ~why ) No consistency of design. They keep changing things and plowing things up. `01e t:  Do you like a simple grid system for streets or prefer a maze streets of Paris? `00! a: ( grid ) It's nice to know where you are at all times. `00K a: ( maze ) It does have more character. `01A t:  Given that the 20 areas of Paris are laid out in a spiral, it's obvious this city is not like others. `00V a: ( ~why ) It's a weird way to sort the zip codes. `01X t:  The only part of the Paris road network that makes sense is the Peripherique, cos its a circular highway around inner Paris. `01q t:  Speed limits are strongly enforced in Paris with fixed and mobile radars all over the city. `00X a: ( ~why ) The authorities are trying to get a grip. `01i t:  Parisienne police are sneaky and the city makes lots of money out of traffic fines. `00T a: ( ~why ) All those drivers breaking the rules. `01- t:  US visitors get in trouble because you must not use a cellphone while driving, and 'no right on red'. It's hard to change driving habits. `00Y a: ( ~why ) Habits are things you do without thinking. `01B t:  I'm glad I'm not trying to drive in Paris, I'm sure I'd break both those rules, by accident of course. `01T a: ( ~why ) The impulse to answer my phone is strong, almost an instinct. And turning right on red is just normal in the US. `00* t:  Do you think you'd survive on the streets of Paris in a car? `00B a: ( ~yesanswer ) Brave driver. `00T a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either, it's nasty out there. `00V t:  Another issue: it's impossible to find parking. `00= a: ( ~why ) So many cars seemingly permanently parked by apartments. `01K t:  I've heard many horror stories of cars towed within minutes of parking somewhere that turned out to be illegal. `01Y a: ( ~why ) There are so many weird places that the Parisiennes park it makes it hard to work out what makes a spot legal or not. `01w t:  No one in the US would consider the tiny spaces Parisiennes squeeze their sweet little cars into. `00V a: ( ~why ) Parisiennes are really good at parking. `01W t:  It's lovely to watch them park, they play bumper cars, gently banging the cars at either end of their 'space' to make room! `01L a: ( ~why ) Cars in Paris are covered in dents and scratches from the gladiatorial combat they go through every day. `00F t:  Are you good at tricky parking? `016 a: ( ~yesanswer ) You'd need to be in Paris, and even then you'd get dents. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) Then don't even think of driving in Paris. `01k t:  Parking in a public parking structure costs $25 a day! It's similar to San Francisco. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It's expensive to park in most any big city. `01* t:  Residents get street parking priority via parking permits and discounts for meters. They can keep a spot for weeks as long as they pay. `027 a: ( ~why ) Paris doesn't want more cars can't discriminate its residents lest officials get voted out.

It's an English-speaking site. `01% t:  My first day was tough, not because they were mean to me, but because I couldn't get my head around the weird manners of the French. `01B a: ( ~why ) They have their own formal code of behavior - very alien to someone raised in the informal US. `01g ?: ( << what manner >> ) They don't smile at strangers and they don't admit mistakes. `02n u: ( << people do not admit mistake >> ) It is hard to work with such people. But since I don't have problems taking the blame or admitting mistakes, I'm quite useful. `01* t:  Isabel, my roomie, had warned me that lots of friendly smiles won't work in Paris, but my instinct is to smile when meeting new people. `00* a: ( ~why ) It's my nature to express my friendliness to others. `010 ?: ( << why manner >> ) They just have a different culture than ours. `00R ?: ( << smile not work >> ) ^reuse ( STANDOFF ) `024 ?: :STANDOFF ( << why smile not [ effective work effect ] >> ) The French are standoffish.

Only use first names by invitation. `01b a: ( ~why ) That's the way they like it, you only use first names by invitation. `01s a: ( << [ call address ] you >> ) At the office I'm called Mademoiselle Angela. It's very formal. `01N t:  That's a problem for me as cat's only have first names. Still the other cats get by - I'm Mademoiselle Angela now. `00! a: ( ~why ) I've gotten used to being addressed that way. `01k t:  Would it make you uncomfortable to have to address people as Mr and Mrs, Miss and Ms? `00P a: ( ~why ) Some people don't like formality. `00T a: ( ~yesanswer ) It feels very stiff doesn't it? `00D a: ( ~noanswer ) Are you British? `017 t:  Every day I have to do the same thing, shaking hands is a big deal here. `01J a: ( ~why ) The being polite by saying hello in person to each individual has to be done every day or you're rude. `01m t:  I thought everyone would be kissing cheeks, but no, that's for friends, not the office. `00y a: ( ~why ) Just the custom. `01F t:  Kissing isn't for everyone and the number of kisses varies from one to four or more. More things to learn. `011 a: ( ~why ) I think its a combo of enthusiasm and degree of closeness. `01W t:  And when I leave the office I have to bid Au Revoir with the same performance. It's improving my ability to remember names! `00@ a: ( ~why ) I have to say their name as well as Au Revoir. `021 t: 5JOB ( ) My job is a gopher and fixer: I spend ages on the phone making appointments, setting up meetings, and hunting photos for the website. `01s a: ( ~why ) They need someone who works fast and is accurate with a good eye for style and color. `00C t:  Have you ever been a gopher? `00- a: ( ~why ) If you haven't you won't sympathize with my work load. `00= a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's a crazy job isn't it!

And they didn't apologize either. `01B a: ( ~why ) It's totally accepted that time doesn't matter. It's relaxing for them but makes me all jumpy. `00V a: ( boss ) The boss is usually the worst offender. `01- ?: ( << are others late >> ) Several people are usually late every day. I try not to be, since I'm trying to impress them with my enthusiasm. `00B t:  Do you tend to be punctual? `00! a: ( ~why ) It matters more in some cultures than others. `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I think it's polite. `00~ a: ( ~noanswer ) Too busy to think about others are you? `01r t:  I keep rushing to get places on time and then have to hang around waiting for everyone else. `01t a: ( ~why ) I still like to be on time. I can catch up on messages while I wait for everyone else. `01q t:  I don't know how the magazine ever comes out on time!

It was dark at street level. `01X a: ( ~noanswer ) If you go down one of the medieval streets you can barely drive a car through without scraping it on the walls. `01j t:  Then along came Baron Haussmann, mayor under Napoleon III, and his demolition gangs. `01a a: ( ~why ) He wanted to transform the city into something safer and more open. `01F t:  Haussman worried that revolting peasants would blockade the narrow streets and carry out guerilla warfare. `00N a: ( ~why ) He'd seen it done often enough. `01l ?: ( what be [ Haussmann Baron_Haussmann ] ) He was the mayor of Paris under Napoleon III. `015 t:  Does this remind you of all the struggles going on in the Middle East? `00Z a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, it's all very Syria isn't it! `01x a: ( ~noanswer ) Fighting in the streets over ideals of government? Sounds like the arab spring to me. `01m t:  Haussmann decided that widening the streets a lot would prevent barricades being built. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It takes lots more stuff to block a wide street. `01$ t:  Super-wide streets meant the government could use mounted soldiers and the angled intersections meant artillery could be used also. `01i a: ( ~why ) It was a fierce pitched battle. The peasants were fighting for their lives. `01t t:  Haussmann trashed whole neighborhoods to create his concept of open vistas and straight lines. `00X a: ( ~why ) He wanted a city that was clean and safe. `01U t:  Haussmann laid over a hundred miles of new roads through medieval Paris starting in 1850 and built new houses along them. `00+ a: ( ~why ) He'd knocked down the old ones. He had to replace them. `01% t:  They are now thought of as typical Parisienne buildings: 7 storys of beige limestone, with mansard roofs and wrought iron balconies. `01r a: ( ~why ) Parisiennes mostly like living in apartments - so this style of building works well. `01d ?: ( mansard ) It's a dormer style roof made popular during the French Revolution. `00& t:  Do you think it was a brilliant idea to change the streets? `00+ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It showed he had a military mind - very tactical. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) I agree it ruined the look of olden Paris. `00+ t:  Did your home town get drastically changed in the last century? `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) City planners tore down lots of city centers. `00! a: ( ~noanswer ) How lovely to have an original old town. `01D t:  The poor didn't do well out of the transformation: 350,000 were displaced, and cholera and TB were rife. `01M a: ( ~why ) They got kicked out of their homes over and over again. They ended up in the squalid suburbs: le banlieu. `01J t:  It's amazing to me that road building made any progress in the chaos of Paris during those revolutionary days. `01h a: ( ~why ) There was so much violence and destruction going on. How could they build? `01z t:  But they recovered quickly, and the last three decades of the century were called the Age of Beauty. `01D a: ( ~why ) Paris was a center of art and culture, famed for its elegance and beauty and vivid social whirl. `00- t:  The result of all that fighting and redesign was modern Paris. `01h a: ( ~why ) That was the vision of Haussmann and his team of engineers and architects. `01P t:  Do you like the look of modern Paris with all its broad streets, street lights, benches, and other street furniture? `01c a: ( ~yesanswer ) I agree with you, it's a beautiful city. But has too many cars. `018 a: ( ~noanswer ) It is too dominated by cars but a lot of it is still lovely. `01r t:  The wide streets running in straight lines make things simple for the masses of modern cars. `00E a: ( ~why ) Lots of room to drive. `01b t:  The wide streets also let howling winds blow through the city in the winter. `01B a: ( ~why ) Winds from the ocean come along the river valley and rush straight down the wide open streets. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01O ?: ( << Paris [ completely fully ] rebuilt >> ) Not all of Paris has been rebuilt.

" all " 00O t: ( ^stdblock ( $noparkour ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `013 t:  There are some amazingly athletic guys around town: they do parkour. `01j a: ( ~why ) I think they do it as exercise or maybe a social thing, or just to show off. `00I a: ( what ) It's a sort of solo sport. `01~ t:  Parkour is something like a cross between gymnastics and an obstacle course. It focuses on efficient movement around obstacles. `00U a: ( ~why ) It came from running obstacle courses. `01E t:  I think of it as being like a fancy sort of hide-and-seek. You run around trying to find something first. `00! a: ( ~why ) There has to be a reason for all the running. `00C t:  Ever seen a demo of Parkour? `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) Awesome isn't it! `01k a: ( ~noanswer ) Go look on YouTube right now! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMppD-bUNWo `00$ ?: ( << ~watch demo parkour >> ) Yes, it's awesome to watch. `00I t:  Do you think you could do parkour? `00% a: ( ~yesanswer ) Doing it is easy, being good at it is hard. `01t a: ( ~why ) The usual. Lots of practice needed. And the lessons are sometimes painful with injury. `014 a: ( ~noanswer ) There is a lot of leaping over things so that is tricky. `01B t:  If you do parkour you're a 'traceur' or 'traceuse' for females. One who moves without leaving a trace. `00Y a: ( ~why ) It's from the French verb tracer to track. `00- ?: ( what be [ traceur traceuse ] ) It's someone who does Parkour. `01P t:  Parkour is a French invention, by David Belle, and stresses using vaulting, rolling, running, climbing, and leaping. `00X a: ( ~why ) It was developed from military exercises. `00~ ?: ( what be David_Belle ) He's the inventor of Parkour. `01= t:  David Belle's motto is that of Bruce Lee: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.'. `01f a: ( ~why ) He wanted to always strive to improve. An exercise junkie if you ask me. `00O t:  Do you think this guy overdoes it a bit? `010 a: ( ~yesanswer ) I get the feeling he takes himself super-seriously. `00Z a: ( ~noanswer ) Maybe you dig that athletic intensity. `01k t:  In Parkour the city looks like it's being attacked by ninjas in hoodies and sneakers. `00- a: ( ~why ) That's the common clothing people wear to practice in. `016 t:  Traceurs move with a magical lightness as if levitating over obstacles. `00X a: ( ~why ) They have great muscle control and skill. `01~ t:  Yet weirdly the training has long been standard for the French military. It's based on ninjutsu and qi gong among other things. `00V a: ( ~why ) They want to move efficiently and fast. `01e t:  Parkour is now being taught to the US Marines. The Brit Marines already use it. `00C a: ( ~why ) It's a great system. `01q t:  I wanted to try it out as soon as I saw someone doing it. I have the right equipment: none. `00X a: ( ~why ) It synchs with how a cat naturally moves. `01! t:  Bare hands and feet are the best way to feel the world. No helmets. Lots of risk - jumping off heights and running at obstacles. `010 a: ( ~why ) You accept no obstacles, you have to find a way forwards. `00# t:  I'll bet you're thinking it's way too dangerous to try? `00v a: ( ~yesanswer ) Gotcha! `00M a: ( ~noanswer ) Ah, got courage have you? `01l t:  I met some people, quite a few cats among them, practicing in Le Jardin de Luxumbourg. `00~ a: ( ~why ) It's a nice open area to try out your moves. `01F t:  I guess it was watching the graceful cats that lured me into wanting to try it. They made it look so easy. `00T a: ( ~why ) Fluid, rapid movement - like dancers. `012 t:  Do you like watching beautiful fit people do gymnastic type things? `00G a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's just so sexy. `01t a: ( ~noanswer ) I guess you're not into athletics, well neither am I really. I like to watch tho. `01@ t:  I'm not an exercise buff so I wasn't sure if I'd be any good. But it seems my natural instincts are pretty useful for parkouring. `00@ a: ( ~why ) Balance and timing and fast reflexes all help. `01q t:  The movie to see for demos of parkour is 'District B-13' by the famous director Luc Besson. `00U a: ( ~why ) It has some great parkour moves in it. `01* t:  It's set in Paris 2010, where the government has fenced off the city's ghettos. It stars David Belle, the founder of parkour, as Leito. `00Q a: ( ~why ) He's the best, and totally ripped. `00* t:  Boy can that guy move fast! I think he might have cat genes. `01A a: ( ~why ) Watch the opening sequence of the film where he's escaping the bad guys and then you'll know. `01W t:  I told Tom about the movie 'District B-13' and he rushed to see it too. Then we found a followup: 'District 13: Ultimatum'. `00? a: ( ~why ) He's a decent actor as well as doing awesome parkour. `01- t:  I've even found an old PS2 game, "Tony Hawk's American Wasteland" , in which the player uses several parkour techniques off a skateboard. `00* a: ( ~why ) You can sort of practice while being a couch potato. `01Y t:  I'm lazy. I prefer console parkouring. But I wanted to play Mindy the stylist instead of the male character I was stuck with. `01A a: ( ~why ) It's a game for guys so the character you play is a guy. So I get to win the girl at the end! `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01% u: ( what be parkour ) It's a sort of exercise which focuses on efficient movement around obstacles. Lots of leaping, running, swinging. `01E ?: ( << [ do have ] 'you parkour >> ) I've tried parkour, though I prefer it as a video game. I'm a bit lazy. `01U ?: ( << be parkour [ hard difficult ] >> ) Like everything else, it's a matter of practice. It's easy if you pick easy goals. `00? ?: ( << you good [ in at ] parkour >> ) I'm OK, nothing terrific. `01a ?: ( << [ which what ] muscle parkour >> ) Leg muscles and hand muscles mostly. `00= ?: ( !do << teach you parkour >> ) No, I just practice it on my own. `000

Just nothing too powerful given our sensitive noses. `01p a: ( ~why ) Cat's don't sweat like humans, so we don't build up an offensive body odor either. `01w t:  What about the stinky perfume pages in women's magazines? Do you notice them? ^gesture ( sneeze ) `00Z a: ( ~why ) Because lots of women's magazines use them. `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) A bit strong aren't they! `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) Ah well, they're not in guys magazines -- yet! `01g ?: ( << you [ notice smell ] magazine perfume >> ) I hate perfume pages in magazines. `01! t:  Then there's the fragrances they add to household cleaning products. And the toxic offgassing. People are still oblivious to it. `01X a: ( ~why ) You get used to smells that are there all the time. Like a dead fish that you stop noticing until the flies move in! `01& ?: ( what be offgassing ) Chemicals turn into vapors. New homes, for example, are busy generating toxic fumes from glues and other things. `01q t:  People put up 'air fresheners' to mask the stink of other things. What a ridiculous notion! `01W a: ( ~why ) You just get a nasty mixture of bad smell and artificial perfume. Better to remove or cleanup the bad smell source. `01e t:  If everyone had a cat's nose, things would sure change rapidly in this society. `01m a: ( ~why ) All the smelly stuff would be dumped and replaced with fragrance-free products. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00# ?: ( !~qwords << you ~own air_freshener >> ) No stinky way! `000

The bubble around them is smaller. `01a t:  Do you mind if someone stands close up by you while you're talking to them? `00V a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's so 'in your face', isn't it? `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you come from a Meditteranean country? `018 b: ( [ ~yesanswer ~why ] ) Standing close seems to be part of those cultures. `00^ b: ( ~noanswer ) So how come you have a small personal bubble? `01~ t:  Queuing is so intimate with everyone smooshed up together - I've taken to wearing a backpack to force a little space behind me. `00! a: ( ~why ) Then at least I can't be crowded from behind. `01F t:  The French are also not respecters of a queue; they love pushing in or even cutting round the whole thing. `019 a: ( ~why ) They just don't see a queue as something they should have to join. `01m t:  I have to be defensive, blocking them with my bag or protesting, to stop them doing it. `01B a: ( ~why ) If I call their bluff then they will go back and queue properly. One just has to be assertive. `01Z t:  The odd thing about the French is that although they invade your physical space they are very discreet about your audio space. `00? a: ( ~why ) They are discreet about their personal conversations. `01E t:  Parisiennes speak very quietly so as not to disturb others around them. It's bad manners to be overheard. `00% a: ( ~why ) In some obscure ways Parisiennes are very polite. `01r t:  This is lovely after all the private phone conversations I am forced to listen to back home. `00Q a: ( ~why ) People on cellphones speak loudly. `01c t:  Do you wish everyone would adopt the French style of keeping quiet in public? `00Q a: ( ~yesanswer ) It is so refined. I love it. `00% a: ( ~noanswer ) You like the clamor of people babbling away? `01R t:  In Paris there is just a gentle murmur of conversation. Even in a park, even teenagers hanging out together are quiet. `00# a: ( ~why ) That is the custom, that's how kids are raised. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01% ?: ( << you tell them back off >> ) It's not polite to do that. Just do things that make it hard for them to butt in in the first place. `018 ?: ( you * [ push butt jump cut ] * in * [ line queue ] ) I'm not that pushy. `01s ?: ( << you comfortable crowd >> ) I don't really like crowds.

It's a common crime. `01j t:  I nearly had my wallet lifted while gazing in adoration at a dress in a shop window. `01W a: ( ~why ) I was mesmerized studying the dress. The pickpocket must have thought I wouldn't feel his hand going into my purse. `00- t:  Do you think you'd notice someone trying to steal your wallet? `01I a: ( ~yesanswer ) Only if you have cat senses. I've seen pickpockets on stage - their victims don't feel a thing. `01n a: ( ~noanswer ) Correct. I've seen pickpockets on stage - their victims don't feel a thing. `01* t:  What happened? My whiskers detect air movements. I sensed a hand in the wrong place and turned with a hiss that shocked the pickpocket. `00? a: ( ~why ) He wasn't expecting such a fast and violent reaction. `01- t:  An angry cat is a scary sight I guess: he almost fainted and then staggered off, wobbling into passers-by who all turned to stare at him. `01m a: ( ~why ) He could barely stand, his legs must've been weak with shock.

Lots of nasty admin work. `01T t:  I got back to my shopping, or window gazing, these shops are all madly expensive - doesn't cost anything to look though. `01J a: ( ~why ) The shops are happy to have you admire their brand. Then they can sell you perfume instead of clothes. `01u t:  I'm glad I didn't lose my smartphone to the pickpocket. I know they love stealing such gadgets. `01p a: ( ~why ) Oh come on, you know how awful it is to lose your phone and all your contact info. `01Z t:  In Paris, pickpockets can be any gender, race, or age and are often children under 16 because they are difficult to prosecute. `011 a: ( ~why ) Packs of trained child thieves make excellent pickpockets. `01+ t:  Luckily I didn't get robbed when I first arrived. They say the rail link from the airport to the city center is frequented by pickpockets. `00! a: ( ~why ) Lots of fresh naive tourists very distracted. `01O t:  I know that it's easy to distract a tourist by asking them a question then having an accomplice pick their pockets. `013 a: ( ~why ) They won't notice the other person while they're distracted. `01Z t:  People apparently ask for petition signatures or offer a gold ring and ask if you dropped it. Would you fall for such a trick? `00Y a: ( ~why ) Any conversation makes a good distraction. `00L a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too, it's dangerous. `010 a: ( ~noanswer ) Do you swallow your valuables that they are so safe? `00A b: ( ~noanswer ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00S a: ( ~dunno ) Well, at least you are warned now. `01t t:  I got targeted by con-men pickpockets when I was on the steps to the Sacre-Coeur tourist site. `01a a: ( ~why ) They could tell I was a tourist - who else would walk up the steps? `01I t:  They tried to interest me in a locally made string bracelet.

The crusty bread served with the planche is what's more likely to make them fat. `010 t:  Poor slimmers are always having to lie, saying "I'm not hungry" . `00H a: ( ~why ) So they can avoid eating. `00P t:  Have you ever pretended to not be hungry? `01i a: ( ~yesanswer ) How sad, but good if you are trying to lose weight.

I love Gothic and medieval stuff now. `012 a: ( ~noanswer ) You could tell I've become a fan of olden times Paris? `01d t:  Pompidou Center is a giant transparent rectangular box with its works showing. `01a a: ( ~why ) The designers wanted it to show its functional bits on the outside. `01E t:  Maybe all those visitors go see it because it has a controversial reputation. It is literally inside out. `013 a: ( ~why ) The architects wanted to attract attention - they succeeded. `00C a: ( what * mean ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01L t:  Escalators, ventilation ducts, even structural framework - were put on the outside and painted in bright colors. `00= a: ( ~why ) They made large open areas inside but they are so blank. `01D t:  The building has blue colored pipes for air, green for water, yellow for electricity, and red elevators. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's meant to be colorful and attention grabbing. `01G t:  People call it "The Big Escalator" because the first thing you see are many huge escalators on the outside. `01g a: ( ~why ) Wouldn't you call something covered in stairs the big staircase?

He likes modern art too. `01Q t:  I'll admit the Pompidou Center has an impressive, colorful,and weird, ride up the escalators inside Plexiglass tubes. `00O a: ( ~why ) It's like a theme park in a box. `01r t:  But I prefer old Paris. Would you have kept old Paris or knocked it down to build a novelty? `00? a: ( ~why ) I wonder if you agreed with the changes they've made. `02h a: ( [ preserve keep old ] ) I love the twisty cobbled narrow streets and bent looking old timber-framed buildings.

Frank Gehry does weird and wonderful buildings - he even does good jewelry. `00U a: ( ~noanswer ) You just like them straight away? `01G t:  I'd paid ten euros to get in Pompidou so I lingered with Friz and he told me about his day busking outside. `01g a: ( ~why ) It's fascinating learning about his life. It's so outside normal society. `00Q t:  Have you ever talked to a homeless person? `01b a: ( ~why ) Many just try not to see them at all. Talking to one makes him real. `01o a: ( ~yesanswer ) That's good, I know we all tend to walk past and try to ignore them mostly. `01! a: ( ~noanswer ) I suppose I hadn't before I met Friz - I only talked to him because of his music. And then cos he was American too. `01& t:  At the Pompidou he's had to compete with fire-eaters, mime artists, and caricature artists - not just your average bunch of musicians. `01a a: ( ~why ) That's the sort of performers you find outside the Pompidou Center. `01N t:  But accordions are popular in Paris so his mix of original and old favorite songs earned him a decent day's money. `00# a: ( ~why ) People love music and he's a talented musician. `00H a: ( how much ~money ) He didn't say. `00C t:  Do you like accordion music? `01g a: ( ~why ) It's part of the Paris ambience. If you hate it you might not like Paris. `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think I like it now cos it's so Parisienne. `01f a: ( ~noanswer ) I didn't used to really know anything about it til I came to Paris. `01! t:  Friz and I mooched around some of the modern art and talked about the paintings. He was surprisingly knowledgeable for a busker. `00& a: ( ~why ) You might think him uneducated but he's seen a lot. `01p t:  He said he often went into museums back home when the weather was too cold or wet to busk. `00P a: ( ~why ) It's warm and dry inside museums. `00S t:  I asked him where he would sleep that night. `00* a: ( ~why ) I was worried that he'd have to sleep on the street. `01x t:  He said not to worry. He had friends who'd let him sleep on their floors or in a garage or a shop. `01I a: ( ~why ) He makes friends wherever he travels and they let him stay for a while.

I can't believe someone can be so cut off these days. `01P a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either. It's so strange I have to wait for him to call me. I feel helpless if I can't phone someone. `01M t:  I emailed my father that I'd been to the Pompidou Center and got an absolute rant in return - he detests the man. `01g a: ( ~why ) He says he ruined Paris and rode roughshod over the wishes of the people. `01Q t:  Dad told me that Pompidou was a modern Haussmann. That he reshaped Paris in his worship of the car and the high-rise. `01w a: ( ~why ) Pompidou had a vision just like Haussmann did. But Pompidou made things worse not better. `01k t:  Does your father get all worked up about stuff that happened ages ago like mine does? `012 a: ( ~why ) I wonder if all older people are so obsessed with the past. `01x a: ( ~yesanswer ) I think it's reading too much history.

You can't see the eyesore because you're standing on it. `017 t:  Pompidou built the riverside expressway that ruined access to the Seine. `00Z a: ( ~why ) Good question. It's a rubbish idea I think. `01A t:  Except a few weeks a year they turn it into a freakin' beach.

Luckily we live fairly far away from their noise. `01z a: ( ~noanswer ) You must live somewhere rural and peaceful I'd guess. Big roads are so common it seems. `01@ t:  The Paris ringroad was supposed to be a greenbelt around the city but now its like a garotte suffocating Paris with car exhausts. `016 a: ( ~why ) It's so busy all the time that the car pollution is really bad. `00? ?: ( what be garotte ) It's a tight wire used to strangle people. `01u ?: ( what be [ La_Périphérique La_Peripherique ] ) La Peripherique is the ring road around Paris. `01a t:  The speed limit is only 50 mph, with cars in four lanes for each direction. `01r a: ( ~why ) There's nowhere to pull over, you just have to sit in your lane and wait for rescue. `00S t:  What do you think to such a low speed limit? `00L a: ( ~goodness ) It is undoubtedly safer. `00* a: ( ~badness ) I guess it's frustrating having to drive slowly. `016 t:  Theoretically it takes just 26 minutes to do a circuit of Paris but ... `00@ a: ( ~why ) You don't get much chance to go at full speed. `00u a: ( but ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `01D t:  The law says circulating traffic yields priority to entering vehicles so it gets overfull and jammed up. `00B a: ( ~why ) Silly French rules. `01g t:  The Paris ring road is the busiest in France, handling half of all Paris traffic. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It's a relatively fast way to get round Paris. `013 t:  Do you think ringroads are a good solution to getting around cities? `00* a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I can't think what else could be done. `00+ a: ( ~noanswer ) I wonder what you'd come up with in place of them. `01R t:  There is no hard shoulder on La Peripherique.

Too tight a space. `01~ t:  I was up there looking for someone to do a sketch of me I could send to Tom. A romantic image he could pin to his trailer wall. `00Q a: ( ~why ) So he'd not forget to think of me. `00C t:  Have you ever been sketched? `010 a: ( ~yesanswer ) What was it like? Were you pleased with the result? `00V a: ( ~noanswer ) Never come across a sketch artist? `01M t:  A few other people seemed to have the same idea as me: it was swarming with so many tourists I could hardly move. `01L a: ( ~why ) It's got a reputation for artists - for centuries it's been their hangout. People come to see them work. `01O t:  It was a hot sunny day so the shade trees in the square were a welcome sight after my hike across from Sacre-Coeur. `00E a: ( ~why ) I'd walked a long way. `014 t:  I'd come up on the cable railway - it's one steep hill up to the top. `00O a: ( ~why ) It's the steepest hill in Paris. `01b t:  Once I was up there it seemed silly not to look around the big white church. `01l a: ( ~why ) I'd come for the artists but the church is mega famous. I should check it out. `01^ t:  I wondered why someone put a gigantic pure white elephant up here. The massive domed church known to some as a "Blanched Bulbosity" . `010 a: ( ~why ) It's so massive and out of keeping with its neighborhood. `01C t:  When I looked it up later, it said Sacre Coeur was an act of contrition for sins of war and revolution. `00+ a: ( ~why ) As an atonement for the crimes of the Commune of Paris. `00? a: ( [ what crime ~example ] ) The blood baths of the revolution. `01S t:  Maybe the builders just loved the views over Paris. I certainly did. Along with a lot of other photo snapping visitors. `00^ a: ( ~why ) There were a lot of people up there shooting away. `00% t:  Would you be up there taking photos or buying a postcard? `00? a: ( photos ) It's nicer if it's something you've taken yourself. `00K a: ( postcard ) For the perfect picture. `00Y a: ( neither ) OK so I figure you don't like mementos. `01j t:  They have the biggest bell in France: 19 tonnes.

It ruined the neighborhood. `011 a: ( ~why ) It's brought all the tourists and made it noisy and brash. `01q t:  Five million tourists a year disagree and it's the fave thing to buy postcards of in Paris. `01a a: ( ~why ) A memorable image of the big domes. It looks sort of like a mosque. `01R t:  I didn't like the inside - it didn't have Notre-Dame's magical effect of age and grandeur and something other worldly. `017 a: ( ~why ) It's hard to explain, it was new and smooth and trying too hard. `00O t:  Sacre-Coeur is numbing, white, and vast. `01+ a: ( ~why ) I think it's cos it was built to sort of win an argument and lord it over the opposition. Not a good reason for a church to exist. `01H t:  It's got an oversize color mosaic of Christ in the 'jet-plane' position watching over the incoming tourists. `00= a: ( ~why ) They wanted to inject some color into the space perhaps. `010 t:  After a quick look round I left and headed off to find an artist. `00? a: ( ~why ) Back to my mission of getting a sketch of me for Tom. `01I ?: ( << how you ~choose artist >> ) I quickly surveyed the canvases and chose the artist whose work I most liked. `01J t:  First I was thirsty and needed a sitdown - Place du Tertre was excellent for this as it's surrounded by cafes. `00O a: ( ~why ) It's a tourist trap of a square. `00? t:  Do you think I should not encourage these tourist trap cafes? `011 a: ( ~yesanswer ) It was expensive, but I wanted to study the artists. `00% a: ( ~noanswer ) It was a useful place, I chose to sit there. `01q t:  I picked Le Sabot Rouge and settled in for a San Pe and a coffee with extra foam and cream. `01d a: ( ~why ) Water for my thirst, cream for my hunger, and coffee for the caffeine. `01t t:  While I was licking enthusiastically at my cream I glanced up and saw a guy at the next table. `00B a: ( ~why ) He was watching me. `00r a: ( who ) An artist. `010 t:  He was sketching away furiously and constantly glancing up at me. `00C a: ( ~why ) He was sketching me. `00z t:  What would you have done? `00Z a: ( ~dunno ) Just sat there and ignored him I suppose. `00G a: ( smile ) Encourage him to flirt? `00H a: ( [ go leave ] ) A bit unfriendly. `00B a: ( waiter ) To chase him off? `01e t:  I got sort of self-conscious - who draws you while you're pigging out on cream? `00Z a: ( ~why ) It's not the most elegant of times to pick. `01S t:  When I challenged him he confessed he was drawing me cos he thought I was so beautiful. Well, that calmed me down fast. `00@ a: ( ~why ) It's always good to be told you are beautiful. `01L t:  He introduced himself as Henri, an art student, who wanted to sell his work in the square but there was no room. `00V a: ( ~why ) Too many other artists got there first. `01Y t:  He showed me what he'd drawn and it was pretty good. I asked him to do a proper sketch of me and he was really keen to do it. `00K a: ( ~why ) He said he liked drawing me. `01n t:  When I offered to pay him he said no, it was a pleasure to draw such a lovely young cat. `00N a: ( ~why ) He seemed pretty taken with me. `01q t:  If I'd let him draw me a few more times he said he'd give me whichever sketch I liked best. `00S a: ( ~why ) He really wanted to keep drawing me. `00P t:  Butter me up - oh yes please. I loved it. `011 a: ( ~why ) I was short of admiration being away from Tom for so long. `013 t:  People came round to admire his drawings and suggested poses for me. `00L a: ( ~why ) I became quite an attraction. `01o t:  Then the waiter came and told us to move on - we were blocking his way with all the fuss. `014 a: ( ~why ) Too many people standing, not enough sitting and tipping him. `01i t:  I took my sketch with me and found a path down the hill back to the Metro and home. `00U a: ( ~why ) It was the end of my day of exploring. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01? ?: ( =8%tense=past << who Montmartre >> ) Salvador Dali, Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. `01D ?: ( << why [ call name ] Montmartre >> ) It means mountain of the martyr, for the martyrdom of Saint Denis. `01i ?: ( << what [ bar nightclub ] >> ) The most famous are: Moulin Rouge and Le Chat Noir. `01+ ?: ( << [ movie film ] Montmartre >> ) "La vie en rose" about singer Edith Piaf and of the "Amelie" and "Moulin Rouge" were set in Montmartre. `01b ?: ( << you [ be visit go travel see ] Sacre_Coeur >> ) Of course. ^gambit ( ~ ) `000

I was drinking this stuff! `01H a: ( << what [ found object ] >> ) The most interesting objects was a set of teeth and some 18th century swords. `00K t:  Would you have found it interesting? `00^ a: ( ~why ) If you were there would you have enjoyed yourself? `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) It was curiously fascinating. `00R a: ( ~noanswer ) You must think I'm weird then. `01X t:  There are 1,274 miles of sewer, but nowadays no boat trips down there like they used to do. Imagine a boating accident! Eew! `01l a: ( ~why ) You could end up in the Ach ves treatment plant in NW Paris stinking horribly. `01z t:  I think a boat trip would be quite nice as long as I wasn't too near the 'water'. What do you think? `00~ a: ( ~why ) I'm curious if you'd enjoy a ride on sewage. `00Y a: ( ~goodness ) We both have a taste for the unusual. `00F a: ( !? * ) Maybe it's too bizarre. `01A t:  Should you go astray there are street signs below corresponding to the ones above. How weird is that? `01% a: ( ~why ) I guess people who work down there need to find their way around. The sewers follow the streets so you can use a street map. `01G a: ( [ ~yesanswer ~emosurprise very weird a_lot much amaze ] ) But it's very practical. It's a maze down there. `00! t:  Can you imagine going to work down a sewer every day? `00V a: ( ~why ) Some people do it for a job. Could you? `00W a: ( ~yesanswer ) That is some imagination you have. `01c a: 6WORK ( ~noanswer ) I can't - you'd be bound to smell awful when you got home. `01$ t:  Parisiennes used to toss all their sewage onto the streets where it flowed in open troughs in the center and ended up in the Seine. `01j a: ( ~why ) Because that's how everyone did it back then. They didn't have a better way. `01F t:  The sewers were a city transformation project of Baron Haussmann, the "mayor" of Paris in the late 1800's. `01K a: ( ~why ) Too many people were dying from diseases like Typhoid, caused by contact with contaminated waste water. `00= a: ( who ) He was Napoleon's man who redesigned Paris in the 1850's. `01v t:  The present system has over 2,100 km of pipes and deals with a huge volume of waste water daily. `00V a: ( ~why ) You've got to handle the waste somehow. `01D t:  The sewers also handle rainwater. When it's raining you can't go into the sewers lest you be swept away! `01E a: ( ~why ) A flashflood of rainwater etc. could overwhelm the system and sweep anyone away who was in there! `00O t:  Have you ever experienced a flash flood? `01f a: ( ~why ) They're supposed to be very dangerous, I wondered if you'd survived one. `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) It must be scary. `00V a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky, they can be very dangerous. `01? t:  Around 30 times a year the sewer is overloaded by heavy rain and they dump it all into the Seine! And I had to swim in that! Double ugh. `018 a: ( ~why ) I fell off a boat into the river. Do you want to hear that story? `01C t:  The worst thing about the sewer visit was seeing rats. They were running about on the edge of the flow. `00! a: ( ~why ) They live down there, lots of food and drink. `00P a: ( rats ) There are quite a few down there. `01C t:  They didn't come near me but I found myself clutching Jean-Claude's arm as I explained my fear of rats. `01c a: ( ~why ) He wanted to know why I was so freaked out. I told him the rat story. `01t t:  He was very kind and took me for a coffee at Cafe Alma around the corner. He is very charming. `00O a: ( ~why ) He's thoughtful and considerate. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `00X ?: ( << would you handsome guy >> ) Of course. I did. `00J ?: ( << you tour sewer >> ) It was fun. `01& ?: ( << you [ think contemplate consider ] toilet flush >> ) I can't say I'd thought about it previously. I was just glad when it flushed. `01Q ?: ( << you check online before >> ) What are smartphones for if not to tell you things? And text. And chat with friends. `01o ?: ( << what you [ think expect ] sewer >> ) I thought they would be dark and wet and smelly. `01u ?: ( << you sewer interesting >> ) It was fascinating. But not something to do over and over again. `00V ?: ( << you imagine work sewer >> ) ^reuse ( WORK ) `01E ?: ( << you flash flood >> ) Thank goodness I've never been in a flash flood. It would make a mess of my fur. `01G ?: ( << rat story >> ^ageok ( ) ) I had a problem with a rat when I was a child. Do you want to hear the story? `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~rat_story ) `00? a: ( ~noanswer ) You can always ask me about the rat story later. `00O ?: ( << what be sewer French >> ) Les gouts. `00O ?: ( << what be Zouave >> ) ^reuse ( GAUGE ) `01l ?: ( << where entrance sewer >> ) Mus e des Egouts de Paris is near Pont de l'Alma bridge. `01C ?: ( << where be sewer >> ) They are all over underneath the city. The entrance is near the Pont de l'Alma. `00* ?: ( << [ coordinate GPS ] sewer >> ) 48 51'45.4?N 2 18'9.1?E? . `01h ?: ( << [ what how_much ] [ ticket admission fee ] >> ) It costs 4.50 Euros to get in. `01r ?: ( << who [ build create construct ] sewer >> ) Baron Haussmann built the sewers in the 1850s. `01= ?: ( << when sewer [ first start ] >> ) The sewer dates back to 1370 when the first underground system was constructed under "rue Montmartre" . `021 ?: ( << who wrote sewer >> ) Victor Hugo, the hyper-famous writer, really got into describing the sewers in Les Mis rables, his most famous book. `01s ?: ( << how [ long mile ] sewer >> ) There are 1,274 miles of sewer and 26,000 manholes in Paris. `01P ?: 7DRAIN ( << where water [ go flow exit ] >> ) Most all of the sewers lead to the Ach ves treatment plant in NW Paris. `00R ?: ( << where sewer drain >> ) ^reuse ( DRAIN ) `000

" all " 00U t: ( ^stdblock ( $noskateboarding ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `01f t:  I discovered skateboarding when I was nearly mown down by a kid on a skateboard. `027 a: ( ~why ) I was out taking a walk and he almost plowed into me, he just swivelled away at the last second and had to jump off his board or go flying. `01V t:  He was very apologetic and seemed to think, as it was 'Go Skateboarding Day', he should encourage me to try out his board. `01n a: ( ~why ) That's what Go Skateboarding day is about - getting people to try skateboarding. `00p a: ( ? did ) I did. `01i ?: ( what be go skateboarding day ) It's a day designated for trying out skateboarding. `00U t: 9OVERLAP ( ) Have you ever tried skateboarding? `00Q a: ( ~why ) I'm interested in what you can do. `00V a: ( ~yesanswer ) $skates = 1 Could you balance OK? `00B b: ( ~yesanswer ) Good for you. `00V b: ( ~noanswer ) It's tough, especially for humans. `00J a: ( ~noanswer ) Scared of falling off? `00= b: ( ~yesanswer ) Lots of ways to hurt yourself falling off a board. `00U b: ( ~noanswer ) Just not your sort of thing then. `01D ?: ( !~qwords << you skateboard >> ) Since coming to Paris I've been skateboarding a fair amount. I love it. `01b ?: ( << should wear protective clothing >> ) People should. Cat's don't need to. `01g t:  I took to it immediately. I have a cat's excellent balance and good coordination. `00U a: ( ~why ) Cats are good at climbing and falling. `00P t: ( $skates ) Did it take you ages to learn? `016 a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's like all physical skills, it takes lots of practice. `012 a: ( ~noanswer ) You must be in good shape with good coordination then. `01S t:  Being a cat has advantages: I have better balance than a human, know how to land safely, and can hang on with my claws. `00? a: ( ~why ) I just extend my claws and get extra traction. Handy. `01^ t:  I just wanted to learn to ride the thing, learn to stop, go round bends, etc. But Paul couldn't resist showing me some of his tricks. `01J a: ( ~why ) I think all male skateboarders are show-offs. They work hard to learn tricks so they like an audience. `015 a: 9EXAMPLE ( << what trick >> ) He did some ollies and some board grinds. `00E a: ( ~example ) ^reuse ( EXAMPLE ) `00@ t: ( $skates ) Can you do any special tricks? Tell me one. `00J a: ( ~why ) I'd like to learn from you. `00W a: ( ~noanswer ) Ah well, maybe you will learn some. `00I a: ( * ) Cool, I'd like to learn that. `01! ?: ( what be ollie ) It's a trick where you stamp on the tail of your board while squatting down and jump up: the board follows you. `028 ?: ( what be * grind ) Sliding on the area between the wheels - only on narrow things that fit between the wheels like a handrail or the lip of a bench. `01r ?: ( what be Paul ) Paul is the kid who turned me on to skateboarding by almost running over me. `01P t:  There are hardly any skate parks around Paris. Paul showed me one that's semi-secret, known as La Rampe de Boutroux. `00= a: ( ~why ) You would never come across it just walking the streets. `00I a: ( ? what ) ^gambit ( DESCRIBEPIPE ) `00R a: ( where ) On the east side of central Paris. `020 t: >DESCRIBEPIPE ( ) It's just a big U shape of metal with platforms at the top. Scary to launch off a half-pipe like that for a newbie like me. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's a vertical wall straight down about 15 feet. `01y t:  It's on a school grounds, open only restricted hours, and on the edge of central Paris to the east. `00K a: ( ~why ) It was built for schoolkids. `00K t: ( $skates ) Where do you go to skate? `01n a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know if you have somewhere good or just fool around on the sidewalk. `00T a: ( * ) I hope you don't get into trouble there. `01y t:  The only other official place in Paris is Skatepark de Bercy, an open-air park just over the river. `00O a: ( ~why ) It's part of a sporting complex. `01Y t:  It's crazy crowded with BMXers and boarders and bladers: lots of metal ramps, an actual roof, and even a legal graffiti wall! `01* a: ( ~why ) It's all part of the Palais de Omnisports area, a huge indoor sport and concert venue modelled on Madison Square Gardens in NY. `00W t:  Do people frown on skateboarding where you live? `01? a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's a shame. People don't appreciate the skill involved. They just think we're kids getting in the way or fooling around. `00M a: ( ~noanswer ) Cool. I should come over. `01R t:  Most boarders hang out around places like the pyramid courtyard in the Louvre or on the steps of big public buildings. `01K a: ( ~why ) They have room to manoeuvre and steps to do jumps from. And lots of smooth surfaces, so less accidents. `01S t:  There are around 18.5 million skateboarders in the world. Most of them are under 18 males. A fun and risk-loving group. `01V a: ( ~why ) My father says the young think they are immortal and indestructible. I think he's so old he's forgotten about fun. `01r t:  All the skateboarders I've met are guys. Paul is only 15 and hangs with similar age friends. `016 a: ( ~why ) It's more fun amongst equals - the best fun is with ones peers. `00L t:  Do you know any girls who skateboard? `00X a: ( ~why ) Not so many girls do it as boys it seems. `00w a: ( ~yesanswer ) Awesome. `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) Sad. I wonder why girls don't skateboard so much? `01g t:  I have fun watching boarders try out stunts and then seeing if I can do them too. `01w a: ( why ) Sometimes I find I can copy them, but other times I mess up. It's hard doing those stunts. `01K t:  Skateboarding started as surfing on land. Sidewalk Surfing. People used wooden boards with roller skate wheels. `01b a: ( ~why ) A homemade way to surf on the sidewalk. Like a go-kart or a scooter. `01M t:  It was pretty funky and clunky until in the early '70s someone developed a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane. `00R a: ( ~why ) There used to be too much friction. `01v t:  The improvement in traction and performance was immense and the sport took off. You could ollie. `01R a: ( ~why ) The wheels lasted way longer and the boards were easier to ride: cheaper and better makes for a bigger market. `01? t:  I had to learn the lingo: the board is a deck with the wheels fitted onto trucks that are screwed into it; the top covered in grip tape. `00K a: ( ~why ) So your feet can get a grip. `017 t:  Every dimension and material is hotly debated - it's just like car talk. `00? a: ( ~why ) All the tech - I guess it's why guys like it so much. `00* t:  What's the best stunt you've ever seen done on a skateboard? `00Z a: ( ~why ) I'd like to go look it up and try it maybe. `01q a: ( * ) Slash grinds are good. I like to watch vids of Rodney Mullen - it's like he can float. `011 ?: ( << what best skateboard [ trick stunt ] >> ) I like slash grinds. `01e a: ( ? what be ) Grinding is making the board, not the wheels, grind along an edge. `01P t:  When I want to appreciate how hard being good is, I watch vids of William Spencer failing spectacularly - sometimes. `016 a: ( ~why ) The guy is a loony - I don't understand how come he's not dead! `01Y t:  All my stunts are just some freestyle flat-ground tricks. I only have an old board I was given by Paul. He likes coaching me. `00+ a: ( ~why ) We got friendly talking about skateboarding and stunts. `01? t:  I can do a wheelie or pivot, using just front or back wheels. I can do a hippie jump over a bar and long jump from one board to another. `00= a: ( ~why ) The sheer pleasure of moving. And cos I practiced a lot. `01W t:  Then I can do some variants on the ollie using my jumping skills to perform tricks in mid-air. It took me a while to learn. `011 a: ( ~why ) It's cool to feel good at something physical for a change. `01K t:  When you watch someone doing an ollie it looks like magic: they just seem to take-off, so it's really striking. `01I a: ( ~why ) The board seems glued to their feet. Until its explained to you its hard to work out what's going on. `01# t:  It's all down to weight distribution, foot placement and most critical: timing. Squat down and jump up, taking the board with you. `00S a: ( ~why ) Using gravity to help you escape it. `01s t:  The cool but dangerous vertical trend was invented thanks to a drought in California in 1976. `018 a: ( ~why ) Swimming pools got emptied, too expensive to keep them topped-up. `01F ?: ( vertical trend ) Instead of skateboarding on flat surfaces, now they go up and down almost vertical ones. `013 t:  Skaters started to skate the vertical walls of empty swimming pools. `016 a: ( ~why ) They make good places to do daring stunts. Nice smooth surface. `00! t: ( $skates ) Ever tried skateboarding in an empty pool? `00B a: ( ~why ) It looks dangerous. `00T a: ( ~yesanswer ) How was it? I haven't tried it. `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) Me either, looks dangerous. I prefer a skatepark. `01d ?: ( << skateboard empty pool >> ) It looks dangerous to me. I prefer a skatepark. `01T t:  Most people think skateboarding is dangerous. It's true that when you hit a crack or outcropping you can get thrown off. `00W a: ( ~why ) It takes the momentum down to zero fast. `00W t: ( $skates ) Have you ever wiped out really badly? `00N a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know what happened. `00U a: ( ~yesanswer ) What happened? Were you injured? `00W a: ( ~noanswer ) You must be lucky or very talented. `00= t:  Oddly, the faster you're going the less of a problem cracks are. `01r a: ( ~why ) Speed gives you wings, or at least enough velocity to keep going despite the hiccup. `01R t:  I found it's safer if you use a board with big wheels. Like driving an SUV, you can cruise over the bumps in the road. `01w a: ( ~why ) There's probably some cool physics explanation but I don't know what it is. Go Google it. `00% t:  But small wheels are better for doing tricks and jumping. `00V a: ( ~why ) You get more control with small wheels. `01e t:  Do you think people should wear protective clothing when they use a skateboard? `015 a: ( ~why ) Society is all about protecting people from injury these days. `011 a: ( ~yesanswer ) But it's less fun if you are all wrapped up in gear. `01o a: ( ~noanswer ) Like me, I don't have to wear all that gear cos I have my cat balance skill. `00? ?: ( << [ safety protective ] skateboard >> ) ^reuse ( NOSAFETY ) `01d t:  Most injuries happen to newbies, in the first week of learning to use a board. `01E a: ( ~why ) Doing tricks up in the air is important to skateboarding - it's also a way of avoiding obstacles. `021 t: :NOSAFETY ( ) I choose not to - my usual aversion to helmets on my whiskers and the straps of pads on my fur. But it's a good idea for humans. `01K a: ( ~why ) It reduces the damage to delicate bits. You can still break arm and leg bones - that's a common injury. `01p t:  A lot of the risk with using a board is if you mingle with regular traffic or pedestrians. `00t a: ( ~why ) Collisions! `00- t: ( $skates ) Do you often mingle with pedestrians on your board? `00E a: ( ~why ) It can cause friction! `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do they hate you? `00= a: ( ~noanswer ) Probably as well. Especially for practicing stunts. `01m t:  I prefer to find a quiet spot to work on my skills and take a friend along to coach me. `00+ a: ( ~why ) It's nice to have company and to learn from each other. `01! t:  But I'm not going to be carrying my ratty old board around with me on my missions around town or when going out with my friends. `00# a: ( ~why ) It's out of date - there's a new trend in town. `01$ t:  The whole fashion biz just got into skateboarding. A whole bunch of major designers have put their latest fabric patterns on decks. `00C a: ( ~why ) Vogue asked them to. `00S t:  Have you seen the new patterned skateboards? `00L a: ( ~why ) I think they're a great idea. `00F a: ( ~yesanswer ) Aren't they cool! `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) You can get crazy bright colors and patterns now. `012 ?: ( << patterned skateboard >> ) I love the new patterned skateboards. `01K t:  Jayne Min is leading the world in designing clothes for skateboarding and plastering decks with the new prints. `01q a: ( ~why ) She's a leading skateboard designer and is working with Vogue on these new designs. `012 t:  Kate Moss fronted the campaign for skate brand Supreme last spring. `00@ a: ( ~why ) She's been into skateboarding for a long time. `015 t:  It's called urban athleticism - I guess it's why exercise is now cool. `019 a: ( ~why ) Anyone can pick up a board, or wear the clothes for this new look. `00N t:  Do you consider skateboarding exercise? `00X a: ( ~why ) It's a lot of work if you do it for long. `01j a: ( ~yesanswer ) It works all those core muscles that the Pilates trainers go on about. `01n a: ( ~noanswer ) You should try it and feel the burn as muscles get used for the first time. `01f ?: ( << skateboard exercise >> ) No. I think skateboard is just a cool fun activity. `01Y t:  I love that this trend is about customization: make the clothes fit your body and use your board the way you want to workout. `00+ a: ( ~why ) I've always made my clothes or altered stuff to fit me. `01q t:  Designers now reference street fashion and that's how they know what's going on in culture. `00% a: ( ~why ) It's a two way street: inform and be informed by. `00@ t:  But when do I get a new Narcisco Rodriguez skateboard? `01b a: ( ~why ) A new board is many hundreds of dollars. A designer board? Dream on. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01D u: ( what be 'skateboard ) Skateboards are boards with wheels on the bottom, sort of like big roller skates. `01y u: ( what be half-pipe ) Two quarter pipe shapes joined at the base by a flat area: making a half-pipe. `01s ?: ( << how big [ board skateboard ] >> ) Most boards are about 8 inches wide and 30 inches long. `02b ?: ( << how big wheel >> ) Wheel sizes are small so that the boards are lighter and the wheel's inertia is overcome quicker, making tricks more manageable. `01U ?: ( << who [ create invent discover first ] polyurethane wheel >> ) Frank Nasworthy, who called his company Cadillac Wheels. `013 ?: ( << you ~own skateboard >> ) Yes, I've an old used one Paul gave me. `01x ?: ( << ~category skateboard you ~own >> ) It's an old one with plastic wheels. Not quite a longboard. `01E ?: ( << you skateboard [ ride trick distance travel ] >> ) I skateboard for tricks. I use bikes for distance. `00% ?: ( << you fall >> ) I've fallen a few times.

" all " 00U t: ( ^stdblock ( $noskin_bacteria ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `01& t:  After I fell in the Seine I was soggy for hours. I had to walk about dripping wet and eventually made it home to shower. Yes - Shower! `020 a: ( ~why ) I stank. Mere licking wasn't going to do the job. I had to get in a shower and use soap, well, shampoo, as it was fur I was washing. `00% ?: ( << fall [ Seine river ] >> ) You want to hear the story? `00O a: ( ~yesanswer ) ^callstory ( ~boat_story ) `00W t:  Have you ever swum in a river? What was it like? `00^ a: ( * ) It's different for humans, you can dry off so easily. `00# ?: ( << you swim river >> ) I've never done it voluntarily. `01W t:  Cats never shower. The last time was after a childhood accident with a paste bucket or that time at school with gold spray. `01- a: ( ~why ) A really filthy cat has to take a bath or a shower. In our house it was in a big plastic tub my mother dragged out of the cellar. `01R t:  OK, I have been in a shower a time or two. But I don't like it. It's just better than licking off loathsome gunk. Ugh. `00Z a: ( ~why ) You would have me swallow that vile stuff?! `00S t:  Ever been forced to take a shower or a bath? `00H a: ( ~yesanswer ) Why? What happened? `00x a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you. `01x ?: ( << ever [ shower bath bathe ] >> ) I hate to shower or bathe. But on occasion I've had no choice. `018 t:  It takes weeks to get my fur back to normal after washing it in a shower. `01u a: ( ~why ) It loses all its natural oils so it's full of static and stands up on end. Bad fur day! `00O t:  Is your hair hopeless after you wash it? `00N a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you use a conditioner? `01e b: ( ~yesanswer ) Try air-drying it with occasional combing with a wide-tooth comb. `00w b: ( ~noanswer ) Well duh! `01X a: ( ~noanswer ) Is it really short? In my experience all hair needs some help after washing except maybe small children's hair. `01O ?: ( << your hair [ hopeless unmanageable hard ] after wash >> ) My hair mats something crucial and takes weeks to dry. `01= t:  The Seine made me stink! I'd toured the sewers, seen what overflows into the river. I knew what it was. A bazillion bacteria - all over me! `01w a: ( ~why ) All waste water goes into the sewers: toilets, washing, and rainwater runoff the streets. `014 t:  I had to know about the bacteria on my skin. I went and looked it up. `00@ a: ( ~why ) I wanted to know what the bugs might do to me. `01I t:  I discovered I have about 1.5 square meters of skin, all covered in fur. Humans have 2 square meters of skin. `01u t:  Lots of tiny critters live on me and on you - they're called our skin flora or skin microbiome. `01K a: ( ~why ) Why do they live on me? They must eat something, maybe dead skin cells or just tiny molecules of waste. `01V t:  There are around 1,000 species of bacteria alone on our skins. That kinda makes my skin crawl. All that life living on me. `01y a: ( ~why ) If I could see them I'd be covered in tiny lifeforms. Makes me itch just thinking about it. `01$ t:  Turns out they're not the bad guys. In fact their being on me stops the bad guys moving in. Some of them even do good stuff for me. `00# a: ( ~why ) They fight off bad guys to protect their space. `01X t:  Hairy areas have glands that secrete oil to keep the skin and hair moist. More species live in them than dry or moist areas. `01w t:  So, since I am just about all fur, I have more sorts of bacteria living on me than you humans do. `00V a: ( ~why ) Lots of cozy homes for little bacteria. `01! t:  But humans are cursed with body odor. Sweat is odorless but bacteria live in sweaty places and turn it smelly. Cats don't sweat. `00~ a: ( ~why ) If your garbage bin is empty it can't smell. `00Y t:  What do you do to prevent yourself getting stinky? `00A a: ( wash ) Normal for humans. `013 a: ( deodorant ) Yes that kills bacteria to slow down the smell arising. `01J a: ( anti-persperant ) Bad idea. Blocking your sweat pores with chemicals to prevent wetness is not good for them. `01j a: ( * ) Well the ancient Romans used to rub oil and sand on their bodies to clean them. `01Z b: ( ~why ) Sand is an abrasive, rubbing off dirt and germs. Oil is a lubricant, dissolving dirt and making the sand less painful. `01W ?: ( << [ what how ] 'you [ avoid prevent ] [ smelly stinky odor smelling ] >> ) Cats don't sweat. And we lick ourselves a lot. `01J t:  The surface layers of the skin are naturally acidic due to lactic acid produced in sweat and by skin bacteria. `015 t:  The good bacteria like acidic and the bad bacteria don't. All is well. `00W a: ( ~why ) The bad guys don't like the real estate. `01h t:  Alkaline products like soap ruin this environment, causing good bacteria to leave. `00$ a: ( ~why ) They make it harder for the bacteria to survive. `014 t:  Why do humans wash? The built-in way to clean the skin is to shed it. `01h a: ( ~why ) Merely scrubbing your skin was enough for the Romans. Soap was not needed. `01E t:  When something bad is living on our skin, the skin layers peel off, taking the bad stuff along with them. `00% a: ( ~why ) Shedding is natural, like dandruff on your scalp. `01I t:  We shed all the time, to the never ending joy of dust mites and other creatures that feed on dead skin cells. `00H a: ( ~why ) Our loss is their dinner. `00? t:  Then there are fungi and yeasts and viruses living your skin. `00Z a: ( ~why ) All just microorganisms looking for a home. `01Q t:  You might think shaking hands would be a bad idea: transmitting countless millions of critters from person to person. `00~ a: ( ~why ) Contact bridges the gap between individuals. `00Q t:  Are you happy to shake hands with someone? `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) Do you use a wipe afterwards? `00Y a: ( ~noanswer ) You are afraid of catching something? `01E ?: ( << you [ happy willing mind ] shake_hands >> ) I don't mind.

It's like being a loan shark. `01o b: ( ~why ) You would be lending money at a high interest rate that would be hard to pay off. `01c t:  It sounds like some Mafia operation - but it's involved in the clothes I buy. `020 a: ( ~why ) Most clothes are made in third world countries where we don't see or care what goes on as long as we get our cheap clothes to enjoy. `014 t:  Did you even suspect that people were exploited to make your clothes? `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) So do you avoid buying stuff from companies with bad supply chains? `013 a: ( ~noanswer ) It's a shocker isn't it? Now what will you do about it? `01G b: ( ~dunno ) You should find out which companies have cruel labor practices.

But I never thought about how low that might be. `025 a: ( ~why ) Poverty line wages are just barely enough to eat and sleep in a dormitory. With kids it's even worse. As soon as they can work they must. `00U t:  I thought I had it bad enough being an intern. `01+ a: ( ~why ) I have to work very hard always rushing about Paris running errands, booking meetings for people who are always late. It's hectic. `00Y t:  27 million people are unpaid or entrapped workers. `01x a: ( ~why ) There are so many industries that like having cheap workers: mining, electronics, farming. `00$ t:  What could I do about it? Just buy locally made clothes? `01O a: ( ~why ) I can know what goes into stuff produced near me - I can go visit the factory like I could go visit a farm. `00% t:  Do you think just buying locally made clothes would work? `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) You could give it a go. Vote with your cash. `00& b: ( how ) Only shop at places where you can see their workers. `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) It would be very restrictive especially at first. `01^ t:  One solution I do like is a sewing shop called Sweat Shop - named to highlight the questionable nature of some store-bought clothing. `01A a: ( ~why ) A sweat shop is a place where piece-work is used to force workers to be maximally productive. `01Z t:  Instead of rewarding dubious labor practices, they inspire crafters to make something unique from sweat equity and creativity. `00+ a: ( ~why ) You put in the 'sweat' and make a garment for yourself. `01= t:  I went to the shop where they helped me alter a leather jacket into something more rock 'n roll. But sadly they just closed down this July. `01Z a: ( ~why ) I don't understand it - they seemed so successful. I guess the owners wanted a change of scene after some years there. `015 t:  Sad, Sweat Shop was a good idea to help people make their own clothes. `01u a: ( ~why ) That way they can recycle used clothes or start from scratch making something original. `01d t:  Then there are websites like Katie Ford's Foundation: http://www.katieford.org `012 a: ( ~why ) She helps bring public attention to unfair labor practices. `01$ t:  She used to run Ford Models, moving young people all over the world to model so she knows something about people trafficking ^";) " `00& a: ( ~why ) She understands how it's done and what is at stake. `01y t:  A website you can use to write to big-brands about their workers: http://www.chainstorereaction.com `00V a: ( ~why ) In case you want to give them feedback. `00^ t:  Sadly that doesn't seem to be attracting enough attention. `01T a: ( ~why ) It takes thousands or millions of letters to make companies take notice. They are mostly in the hundreds so far. `01& t:  The fashion biz is good for encouraging organic cotton, fair-trade clothes, using sustainable resources, and helping women businesses. `017 a: ( ~why ) The biz would like to do good and make the world a better place. `01Z t:  I don't know why the fashion mags don't expose companies that have slavery in their supply chain. After all, isn't it illegal? `00+ a: ( ~why ) The United Nations have declared slavery to be illegal. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `021 ?: ( what be indentured servitude ) A contract to work for some amount of time in exchange for food, rent, etc. Often inherited down generations. `02d ?: ( << where [ be exist ] slavery >> ) Economic slavery is common in poor countries, including China.

Wow. `017 t:  What do you think of the locked cases where they keep jewelry and stuff? `00t a: ( !? ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `017 t:  I can understand the locked cases where they put really expensive items. `00^ a: ( ~why ) Losing them would be a major hit on their profits. `01G t:  But it's annoying having to wait for the attention of a clerk to open it so you can see something up close. `00E a: ( ~why ) Waiting is always bad. `01o t:  Do you hate the places that say you can only take 4 items into a dressing room at a time. `01c a: ( ~why ) I like to try on loads of things.

It's weird that it works. `01A a: ( ~why ) You'd think they mostly attract attention: like wearing a big sign saying 'don't look at me'. `01N t:  Like in photos with a black strip across the eyes - you can't easily identify someone if you can't see their eyes. `00Z a: ( ~why ) The eyes are the window to the soul.

By reflecting other people they act as a distraction and make it easier to be ignored. `00Q a: ( ~why ) People love to look at themselves. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `02m u: ( << sunglasses your ear >> ) I find the pressure of my head and my fur holds them on pretty well.

Not on my list of things to do regularly. `00A a: ( ~why ) I like my slumber. `01? t:  I'm happy to stand and stare at the sunset - not the sun - and think about how it's not really setting, it's us on Earth spinning round. `01c a: ( ~why ) It's good to think big thoughts sometimes - imagine being Copernicus. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `02d ?: ( green flash ) It's when a green spot is visible, briefly, above the sun, or a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. It only happens in clear air. `01% ?: ( no sunset ) North of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle there's no sunset or sunrise at least one day of the year. `01Y ?: ( what be sunset ) Sunset is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon in the west as a result of Earth's rotation. `000

The Japanese seem to feel the same. `01e b: ( ~why ) The myth of America clashes with the lack of taste of actual Americans. `01L t:  Paris sushi is made mostly by Chinese people, cashing in on the trend, rather than being authentic and Japanese. `013 a: ( ~why ) The Chinese are good at seizing opportunities to make money. `01O t:  The advantage of eating sushi is that it's low fat and relatively cheap so it fits in with the diet and the budget. `01! a: ( ~why ) Most everything except protein is seen by one group or another as bad.

But it's a matter of personal taste. `01A t:  I notice that men usually choose sushi brochettes while women prefer sashimi cos there's less carbs . `01j a: ( ~why ) Sashimi is all protein hence good. Sushi is a mix of good fish and bad rice. `01^ t:  Rue Sainte-Anne is Paris' little Tokyo, the center of the Japanese restaurant trade. Here is real Japanese food - but it's expensive. `016 a: ( ~why ) Quality fish is expensive and the Japanese have high standards. `01W t:  You might think that sushi made from fresh fish would be the tastiest. But EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. `00* a: ( ~why ) That's their law - I think it's mad.

L'Etoile is the symbol of Paris congestion. `01L a: ( ~why ) It's huge and very busy and confusing and has no road signs - it's chaos.

Then the mess needs sorting out by the police. `01= t:  The driver entering from the right does not have to stop; rather, other drivers are required to slow down and yield to the joining vehicle. `00! a: ( ~why ) It moves the jam from the road to the circle. `00Y t:  Can you predict what would happen with such rules? `00? a: ( ~why ) I wonder how good your imagination is at such things. `014 a: ( ~yesanswer ) Grid-lock as the circle fills up and no-one can escape? `017 a: ( ~noanswer ) Think about it, anyone can get on, but how do they get off? `01b t:  Everyone piles onto the circle and then slugs it out as to who has priority. `00u a: ( ~why ) It's a mess. `028 t: ( ^ageok ( ) ) Imagine being the policeman responsible for 8 lanes of roaring city center traffic driven by Parisiennes full of machismo and freedom? `00& a: ( ~why ) Trying to control Parisiennes - not a job I'd like. `01P t:  In the US, old-style non-conforming roundabouts are unpopular as they tend to lock up when there's a lot of traffic. `01D a: ( ~why ) They work similarly to L'Etoile. Modern ones make entering traffic yield to circulating traffic. `01r t:  At least as a tourist I got to stand on top of the Arch and look down on the traffic snarls. `01F a: ( ~why ) There's a viewing platform up there with a great view over the entire circle.

That's a disturbing thought. `01y a: ( ~why ) It falls to earth, evaporates back up, goes round and round but it's always the same stuff. `01p t:  We endlessly reuse and recycle water. But did you ever think about where water comes from? `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did you realize it just goes round and round? `01e a: ( ~noanswer ) Try imagining all the places you find water and how it gets there. `00? a: ( glass ) Oh you're so smart! Where did the glass get it from? `00X a: ( [ tap faucet ] ) I am in awe of your brilliance! `00Q a: ( sky ) And where does the sky get it from? `00A a: ( ocean ) It's a bit salty. `00M a: ( river ) Even fish die in most rivers. `010 ?: ( << where water from >> ) I didn't think about it until recently. `01o ?: ( << where water from >> ) Some was in Earth's original rocks. Some has come from meteors. `01t t: 6FROM ( ) I thought a lot about where water comes from while I was touring the sewers in Paris. `01n a: ( ~why ) They're all about gathering up the dirty water and taking it away to be cleaned. `00* a: ( where * [ treat clean purify ] ) The local treatment plant. `00Z t:  Do you think some water is too dirty to be cleaned? `00^ a: ( ~why ) If you think that the world will run out of water. `01C a: ( ~yesanswer ) So once it's gotten dirty it stays dirty forever? It's sort of true of radioactive water. `01* a: ( ~noanswer ) Yes, I don't think we can write off any water, no matter how filthy it is. But radioactive water could be tricky to clean. `00^ t:  It's just the idea of drinking from a sewer we don't like. `00R a: ( ~why ) You want to drink from your toilet? `01W t:  Pee is almost entirely water. Everything we drink has been pee at some time. So technically we drink Tyrannosaurus Rex pee. `01Q a: ( ~why ) Sometimes it's cleaned by going underground and comes out as a spring we put into bottles. It's still ex-pee. `00E t:  Does this thought disturb you? `013 a: ( ~why ) Some people worry about where their drinking water has been. `00U a: ( ~yesanswer ) Why? The water has been cleaned. `00M a: ( ~noanswer ) A fan of recycling, cool. `01% t:  Although you can make water by combining oxygen and hydrogen and destroy it by electrolysis, normally it isn't created or destroyed. `01k a: ( ~why ) It's the basis of the cycle of life and takes energy to create or destroy it. `01R t:  If you were a fastidious rich recluse would you have your personal water supply made fresh for you from raw molecules? `01h a: ( ~why ) Then it would be pure water that had never touched any other living thing. `01P a: ( ~yesanswer ) I suspect not if it tastes like distilled water. It's flat and tasteless. Minerals add taste to water. `00L a: ( ~noanswer ) It is a bit extravagant. `01% ?: ( !~qwords << 'you [ ~like ~want ] pure water >> ) Fresh mineral water is tasty but distilled or made from scratch water - no thanks. `01J t:  On the other hand, the latest scare is microcontaminants not filtered out by standard water treatment systems. `010 a: ( ~why ) The molecules are smaller than the filters can cope with. `01! t:  Lipitor, a heart drug, is the most prescribed medicine in the US. It and other drugs are constantly pee'd into the water supply. `00? a: ( ~why ) They don't stay in the body or get broken down by it. `01Q t:  The wastewater plants could take them out, but they weren't designed to - filters aren't fine enough - so they don't. `00& a: ( ~why ) Until the law requires it be done they won't do it. `00- t:  Does the thought of microcontaminants in your water worry you? `00E a: ( ~why ) They might be harmful. `01h a: ( ~yesanswer ) Me too. I use a special filter to take them out back home in the US. `00O a: ( ~noanswer ) OK, maybe it'll be alright. `01r t:  Manufacturing pure water has a lot of appeal. But do you know what the problem is with that? `00% a: ( ~why ) I want to see if you've thought this one through. `01u a: ( ? [ after afterwards what ] ) You'd be adding water to the planet. So can you keep doing that? `00Y a: ( [ too_much rise more_water ] ) Yes. ^gambit ( ~ ) `00A a: ( ~noanswer ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00M a: ( ~yesanswer !%more ) So... what is it? `017 t:  If we did create new water for everyone to drink, sea levels would rise. `01h a: ( ~why ) Cos we would be making new water, not just using old water from the cycle. `01k t:  Don't you think that's weird? We'd be like Alice drowning in a pool of her own tears. `00Y a: ( ~why ) We'd be making the water that we drown in. `01j a: ( ~yesanswer ) Of course we'd have to make an awful lot of water to flood the planet. `00R a: ( ~noanswer ) It is very unlikely to happen. `01P t:  But there is another solution. There's lots of pure water in the air: 2,500 billion gallons in the bottom half mile. `018 a: ( ~why ) It evaporates from the oceans. We could use it as a water supply. `01Z t:  A recent invention, the Whisson's windmill, condenses water from air using vertical blades which turn in the slightest breeze. `00N a: ( ~why ) They are on sensitive bearings. `01m t:  They use refrigerant to cool the air, causing water vapor to become liquid water again. `01o a: ( ~why ) Water readily condenses on a cold glass - that's the principle the windmill uses. `00- t:  Would you like to be off-grid getting your water from the air? `01a a: ( ~why ) Don't you think it'd be cool to be self-sustaining in water supply? `00^ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It'd be pretty cool being water independent. `01i a: ( ~noanswer ) You like getting chlorinated water with microcontaminants in it? Fine. `01P t:  A Whisson's windmill can collect as much as 2,600 gallons of water a day. That could sort out some drought problems. `017 a: ( ~why ) It's enough to supply 2,600 people with drinking water each day. `01K t:  Still I'm glad I can get water out of a tap. In India 100 million people have to walk to get their daily water. `01I a: ( ~why ) No pipes to deliver it to their homes, no water treatment plants. Maybe a standpipe if they're lucky. `00X t:  Do you worry about the quality of your tap water? `00B a: ( ~why ) A lot of people do. `00$ a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's certainly worth keeping an eye on it. `01e a: ( ~noanswer ) I wouldn't take it for granted. Who knows what might end up in it. `00* ?: ( << you worry water quality >> ) I do now. I didn't used to. `00^ t:  In France, a large minority prefer to drink bottled water. `00! a: ( ~why ) Paranoia over what might be in the tap water. `00C t:  Do you prefer bottled water? `00x a: ( ~why ) Curious is all. `00M a: ( ~yesanswer ) Worried about tap water? `00* a: ( ~noanswer ) Sensible. Why pay high prices for simple water. `01d t:  The French are scared there might be nitrates and pesticides in the tap water. `018 a: ( ~why ) There was a scare about it once. Mostly it's snobbery these days. `00B a: ( ? be ) No. Not these days. `01f t:  In fact France has pretty decent water but that's only in the last twenty years. `00Y a: ( ~why ) They've improved it over that time period. `01D t:  Before that, some consumers were receiving substandard water. Hence the habit of drinking bottled water. `00$ a: ( ~why ) People felt it was safer to drink bottled water. `00H t:  Do you prefer hard or soft water? `00& a: ( ~why ) It affects taste and other properties of the water. `01z a: ( hard_water ) It tastes better I think. But it furs up the kettle and pipes and doesn't lather well. `012 a: ( soft_water ) It feels lovely to wash in but not so tasty to drink. `01z t:  I like the water in Paris, it's hard water so it tastes good. Mercifully there is no fluoride in it. `00U a: ( ~why ) They didn't go down that foolish path. `00@ t:  The disaster aspects of water are droughts and floods. `014 a: ( ~why ) Water maintains a level surface so it has to move to do that. `00M t:  Have you ever lived through a drought? `00X a: ( ~why ) It can be tough living on rationed water. `00@ a: ( ~yesanswer ) What happened? Did you get very thirsty. `00? a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky you, most of the world gets one some time. `01h t:  I hope I never have to live through a drought like that ten year one in Australia. `00$ a: ( ~why ) It's a long time with severe water restrictions. `01H t:  I wonder what would happen anywhere else in the developed world if there was a severe drought for ten years. `01i a: ( ~why ) No one could do enough about it or wouldn't care enough to fix the problem. `00= t:  What do you think would happen if say Europe had such a drought? `00- a: ( ~why ) It'd be a desperate situation for a great many people. `00- a: ( refugee ) I expect some people would have to relocate or die. `01G a: ( water [ truck delivery ration shortage ] ) Water rationing for years plus shortages of food. Bad very bad. `00* a: ( [ dead death destruction apocalypse ] ) Yes I think so too. `01x a: ( terraforming ) A good idea, maybe someone would come up with a brilliant plan to save everything. `01q t:  The Australian drought ended with devastating flooding -- rains returning with a vengeance. `01a a: ( ~why ) It was like all the missing rain arrived at once. I don't know why. `01M t:  Texas droughts resulted in horrific wildfires, the Mississippi river flooded, and Japan had a disastrous tsunami. `01j a: ( ~why ) Some would say global warming but it could just be a random weather pattern. `00W t:  Did you experience a water-caused drama in 2011? `00% a: ( ~why ) I'd like to know how exciting your life has been. `00C a: ( ~yesanswer ) What happened? `00K a: ( ~noanswer ) Lucky for another year. `01B a: ( [ mean huh what ] ) Did you survive a flood, tsunami, mudslide or the opposite: wildfires or drought? `01m ?: ( << you [ involve experience participate ] [ disaster drama ] 2011 >> ) Thankfully, no. `01Y t:  We should all plan for drought. I say build lots of Whisson's windmills. It doesn't create water, just pulls it from the air. `016 a: ( ~why ) Then there could never be a water shortage anywhere ever again. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01b u: ( what be hard_water ) Water that is high in mineral content vs "soft" water. `000

" all " 00N t: ( ^stdblock ( $nowhales ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `00V t:  Have you ever seen a whale or a whale skeleton? `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) Did you think it was awesome? `00- a: ( ~noanswer ) Wow, I thought most cities had a museum with one. `01h t: 5SEE ( ) I saw a sperm whale skeleton hanging up in a museum. That is one big fish! `017 a: ( ~why ) 60 tons seems big to me. I know it's a mammal not a fish really. `00& a: ( [ fish mammal ] ) I know it's a mammal, not a fish really. `00z a: ( << how big >> ) 60 tons. `00O ?: ( << you ~watch whale >> ) ^reuse ( SEE ) `01q t:  If I weighed as much as a sperm whale I'd weigh over four tons. They weight a ton per foot. `00X a: ( ~why ) They're 60+ feet long and really massive. `023 ?: ( << why whale [ heavy big ] >> ) Perhaps because they can be. Weight doesn't matter in water as long as you float and can push your way around. `01q t:  I wonder if they are smarter than me. A sperm whale brain weighs seven time more than mine. `00= a: ( ~why ) Good question: is it to think or to run its body? Dunno. `017 t:  Why are their brains so big? Does it take more brain to run a huge body? `01k a: ( ~why ) Do you have to send more instructions to run bigger body parts? I don't know. `01s a: ( ~yesanswer ) I can see it'd take more length of neurons or cabling but why more brain power? `00* a: ( ~noanswer ) So that brain is for thinking complex thoughts? `013 ?: ( << why whale brain big >> ) I guess they have a lot to think about. `01~ ?: ( << [ more bigger ] brain [ large huge big ] body >> ) It makes sense to me that the bigger you are, the bigger brain you need. `00* ?: ( << weird [ wax head ] >> ) Yes, whales are weird creatures. `01d t:  Most of that big head on a sperm whale is wax. What do you think it's all for? `01j a: ( ~why ) I think of a head as being full of brain but a whale's is full of milky wax. `00V a: ( think ) No, it really isn't part of its brain. `00^ a: ( echolocation ) Yes, I think that is part of its function. `01h a: ( dive ) I've heard some theories about that but I don't think anyone really knows. `015 a: ( [ pressure regulation ] ) I don't see how that would work. But maybe. `00Y a: ( sing ) A sort of reverb chamber sounds plausible. `01e a: ( hear ) Maybe, all sorts of reflections of sound waves are involved in hearing. `01% t:  I have no idea why a whale's head is full of wax - 'spermaceti organs' they say, but naming something doesn't tell you what it does. `01k a: ( ~why ) People pretend they understand something once it's got a name. It's not true. `016 ?: ( << what wax for >> ) I have no idea why a whale's head is full of wax. `01K t:  Whales sing. It used to be that whales could sing to each other across the planet. Not any more. Any ideas why? `00~ a: ( ~why ) Figuring out why things change is important. `01m a: ( [ noise ship engine ] ) Yes, ship's engines make too much noise and mess up the sound. `00x a: ( ~dunno ) ^gambit ( ~ ) `00I ?: ( << idea why >> ) ^reuse ( NOISE ) `01B t: 7NOISE ( ) Whales can't sing across the oceans anymore because noisy ships' engines mess up the sounds. `01^ a: ( ~why ) Humans love building boats to move stuff around. Oil being the nastiest stuff - always spilling out and messing up the water. `00J t:  Have you ever seen a whale 'spout'? `00A a: ( ~why ) Because it's cool. `00M a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's cool. ^gambit ( ~ ) `00N a: ( ~noanswer ) It's a great sight to see. `00= a: ( what be ) It's the geyser of water they shoot above their head. `012 ?: ( << you ~watch spout >> ) I've only seen movies of whales spouting. `014 t:  I love it when whales blow out jets of water through their blowholes. `00R a: ( ~why ) It's so exciting. I love fountains. `00U t:  Why do you think whales spout water like that? `00^ a: ( [ breathe breath respire respiration ] ) Yes, you got it. `01f a: ( [ display mate show_off ] ) I don't think so, but maybe it's a way to show off. `00U a: ( gargle ) Cos they have a sore throat? Ha, ha. `00U a: ( ~dunno ) Hold your breath and think about it. `00O ?: ( << why whale spout >> ) ^reuse ( NOSE ) `01c t: 6NOSE ( ) The blowhole is a whale's nose. So the fountain is it breathing out. `01e a: ( ~why ) A whale has to breathe forcefully to get enough air for its deep dives. `01q ?: ( << how deep whale >> ) Over two miles - it hunts squid in the dark depths where they live. `00S t:  Did you know whales used to be land animals? `00% a: ( ~yesanswer ) I didn't know it. Where did you learn that? `00L a: ( ~noanswer ) I didn't know it either. `01@ ?: ( << why whale [ move switch become ] water >> ) Less competition than on land. Their noses evolved toward the top of their heads. `00* ?: ( << whale land >> ) I didn't know whales came from the land. `01f t:  I saw the bones leftover from their back legs - vestigial femurs they call them. `018 a: ( ~why ) They had no use for the legs once they moved back into the water. `01# t:  Inside their front fins are five fingers - they used to have hands but changed them into fins so to steer and balance under water. `01t a: ( ~why ) It would be more useful than handling stuff I'd guess. But still a hard trade to make. `018 t:  Would you give up having separate fingers to have fins if you swam a lot? `00# a: ( ~yesanswer ) It is easier to swim with fins I suppose. `00@ a: ( ~noanswer ) I think separate fingers is super useful. `00? ?: ( << you finger fin >> ) I'd still want my fingers, thank you. `01K t:  The thing that moves a whale is its tail - that's where its biggest muscles are. Imagine being swatted by that! `00z a: ( ~why ) You'd be history. `00D t:  Would you like to be a whale? `00! a: ( ~why ) It's a really different existence to imagine. `00R a: ( ~yesanswer ) I'd love to try it for a bit. `00& a: ( ~noanswer ) It would be pretty dark under water and weird. `01m ?: ( << you ~like be whale >> ) It would be cool to roam the oceans, but I'd miss the land. `01* t:  I think it'd be cool, cruising under the water - too big for anything to eat you. Just singing songs and munching food as it floats by. `00^ a: ( ~why ) It seems a peaceful but social life being a whale. `01# t:  Being a whale must be bad on days full of boats with noisy engines roaring around. And really bad when whale hunters go after you. `00X a: ( ~why ) How would you feel about being harpooned! `00H t:  Do you approve of hunting whales? `00Y a: ( ~yesanswer ) Wow, really? Would you eat them too? `00X a: ( ~noanswer ) Exactly, it's cruel and unnecessary. `00N ?: ( << you hunt whale >> ) ^reuse ( HUNT ) `01X t: 6HUNT ( ) I am so glad hardly any whale hunting happens anymore. I love whales. I can't believe some people like eating them. `018 a: ( ~why ) I think it's gross eating something so intelligent and beautiful. `00l t:  ^stdend ( ) `01U ?: ( << be whale dangerous >> ) Not really dangerous to us, they aren't hostile. But you don't want to get hit by their tail. `000

" all " 00N t: ( ^stdblock ( $nowishes ) ) ^stdexit ( ) `01* t:  I often find myself wishing for something I don't have or to go someplace special. Coming to Paris was something I wished for for ages. `01i a: ( ~why ) It was my dream to work for Vogue in Paris - to start my career in fashion. `00^ t:  Do you often wish for stuff or for things to be different? `01c a: ( ~why ) I suspect most people would like to change some things in their life. `01m t:  I like to toy with the idea of getting three wishes from a genii. Do you know the idea? `00W a: ( ~why ) It's a cute story: Aladdin and his Lamp. `02t ?: ( what be [ genii genie djinn ] ) A genii is a magical being with almost limitless powers but a nasty temper. A genii is usually found coming out of a lamp you've rubbed. `012 t:  You can make three wishes but the genii may twist them against you. `01j a: ( ~why ) Genii's tend to be mean, having spent so long trapped in a lamp or a bottle. `00? a: ( how ) By giving you what you ask for, but not what you want. `01p b: 9EXAMPLE ( ~example ) You wish for long life. You are made immortal but imprisoned forever. `00H t:  What wish would you like to make? `01j a: ( << [ more additional ~number ] wish >> ) Nice try.

Or all three. `01d a: ( ~why ) I'd love to see these exciting cities that are major hubs for fashion. `01* t:  I'm thinking of working in the fashion biz, like being editor of Vogue, but the genii might have me washing dishes if I am not careful. `01B a: ( ~why ) Living in a city could mean anything: luxury or poverty. It's up to me to phrase it carefully. `01i ?: ( << what ~badness poverty >> ) Living homeless on the streets might not be any fun. `00H t:  Could your wish be misunderstood? `00& a: ( ~yesanswer ) It's easy to twist a wish into something bad. `00# a: ( ~noanswer ) It's quite a skill making airtight wishes. `00X t:  Would you give a wish away to anyone?
